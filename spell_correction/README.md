# Machine Translation Model

This is a model using encoder-decoder approach to translate incorrect sentence to a correct
sentence. On doing so, I have been encountering problems improving the model accuracy and 
generating an output. The accuracy keeps fluctuating one run from another.

### Running the files

- Run ```python preprocessing.py``` to generate np-arrays from text file to be used by **model.py**.
- Run ```python model.py```.
