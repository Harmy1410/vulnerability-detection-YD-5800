# Machine Translation Model

This is a model using encoder-decoder approach to translate incorrect sentence to a correct
sentence. On doing so, I have been encountering problems improving the model accuracy and 
generating an output. The accuracy keeps fluctuating one run from another.

### Running the files

- Run command below to generate np-arrays from text file to be used by `model.py`.
```bash 
    python preprocessing.py
``` 
- Run 
```bash 
    python model.py
```
