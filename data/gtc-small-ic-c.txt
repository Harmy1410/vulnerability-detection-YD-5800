The second goal implies a major design choice: the actual logging is completely asynchronous. It means that writing messages to the appenders obviously occurs in a background thread, but also that *all formatting operations are delayed to be performed just before the appending*. **No formatting occurs in the calling thread**; the log data is merely mashalled to the background logging thread in the more efficient way possible.

This post describes several [d3 quantitative scales](d3 wiki) - linear, quantize, quantile and threshold - walking through how they work and the tradeoffs involved when using them to display colors.	This post describes several [d3 quantitative scales](d3 wiki) - linear, quantize, quantile and threshold - walking through how they work and the trade offs involved when using them to display colors.
While the quantize scale makes intuitive sense and is easy to implement, skewed data or outliers can totally alter the color scale. Here a few very large values stretch out the scale, compressing the rest of the values into one color bucket which results in a map with just two colors. Visual differences between lower values are erased and the two colors that remain don't intrinsically communicate anything about the proportions between the values the represent.	While the quantize scale makes intuitive sense and is simple to implement, skewed data or outliers can totally alter the color scale. Here a few very large values stretch out the scale, compressing the rest of the values into one color bucket which results in a map with just two colors. Visual differences between lower values are erased and the two colors that remain don't intrinsically communicate anything about the proportions between the values they represent.
Here, there are 70 values and 5 colors so each bucket has 14 values in it. The first bucket has 14 lowest values which are colored the lightest shade of purple, the second contains the 15th through 29th lowest values and so one. On the scatter plot, the previously horizontal bars are now vertical as the colors of each point is being determined by its rank, not value.	Here, there are 70 values and 5 colors so each bucket has 14 values in it. The first bucket has 14 lowest values which are colored the lightest shade of purple, the second contains the 15th through 29th lowest values and so one. On the scatter plot, the previously horizontal bars are now vertical as the colors of each place is determined by its rank, not value.
The Jenks natural breaks algorithm uses dynamic programing to find groupings of value so that the difference of values within a group in minimized. The breaks for our population of values are calculated and, after light manipulation, passed to domain of a threshold scale. Each break in the domain is matched with a color in the range; values are colored based on the largest break which they are small than. Like the quantize scale, the horizontal rectangles show where the breaks occur.

If you are choosing to use GraphQL on a Wordpress project, it is recommended to use the WPGraphQL plugin. This plugin will return WordPress data in JSON format through a GraphQL endpoint - in many cases you won’t need to write the schema yourself. This will give you all the benefits of concatenating your data requests as well as easy access to your data as it is output by WordPress. You can retrieve your data by passing a query directly into a simple fetch request:	If you are choosing to use GraphQL on a WordPress project, it is recommended to use the WPGraphQL plugin.

If function composition doesn't scare you, then yes, I think so.

I believe using higher-order component helpers leads to smaller, more focused components, and provides a better programming model than using classes for operations—like `mapProps()` or `shouldUpdate()`—that aren't inherently class-y.
That being said, any abstraction over an existing API is going to come with trade-offs. There is a performance overhead when introducing a new component to the tree. I suspect this cost is negligible compared to the gains achieved by blocking subtrees from re-rendering using `shouldComponentUpdate()` — which Recompose makes easy with its `shouldUpdate()` and `onlyUpdateForKeys()` helpers. In the future, I'll work on some benchmarks so we know what we're dealing with.	That being said, any abstraction over an existing API is going to come with trade-offs.

Assuming you are running actionhero across multiple machines, you will need to ensure that only one of your processes is actually scheduluing the jobs.

Sometimes a worker crashes is a severe way, and it doesn't get the time/chance to notifiy redis that it is leaving the pool (this happens all the time on PAAS providers like Heroku).

To aid you in these edge cases, `queue.cleanOldWorkers(age, callback) is available.
Because there are no 'heartbeats' in resque, it is imposable for the application to know if a worker has been working on a long job or it is dead. You are required to provide an "age" for how long a worker has been "working", and all those older than that age will be removed, and the job they are working on moved to the error queue (where you can then use queue.retryAndRemoveFailed) to re-enqueue the job.

If your application needs to work without an Internet connection, you can embed software libraries to call locally. For example, you can grab the [Stanford CoreNLP toolkit](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) to add language processing capabilities to your software, such as "part of speech tagging", which tries to identify where are the nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and so are in your text.

The biggest problem is the rendundancy in our codebase, that makes difficult to keep this things in sync. To add new field to our entity, we have to jump through all the files - modify entity class, then modify part of the schema and then update the interface. The same goes with inputs or arguments, it's easy to forget to update one or make a mistake with the type. Also, what if we've made a typo in field name? The rename feature (F2) won't work correctly.

Rather than explicilty telling a computer how to find a cat, we'll just show the computer lots of examples of cats, and see if the computer can construct a cat detector by figuring out what differentiates cats from dogs or muffins or couches or motorcycles.

Along the way, we're going to explore software that will help you understand if your customers are excited, sad or disgusted by your products. We'll see how simple API calls can identify what objects are in an image. We'll show how to build your own iPhone app that cal tell you whether what you're pointing your camera at is a business card.

The XDM abstract model for data inherits several properties from JSON and JSON Schema, including the its basic type system. One ramification of this is that objects in XDM are semantically equivalent to maps. In XDM, objects are defined as maps from a valid JSON-LD property (a full URI, a compact URI, they keyword `@id`, `@type`, etc) to any XDM-defined value.

This solution is meant to be a quick and dirty (but functional) method of bypassing geo-restrictions for various services. While it is (at least in theory) called a `smart DNS proxy`, the only `smart` bit is in the `zones.override` file, which tells the system which domains to proxy and which to pass through. You could easilly turn this into a `dumb/transparrent DNS proxy`, by replacing the contents of `zones.override` with a simple[n4] statement:	This solution is meant to be a quick and dirty (but functional) method of bypassing geo-restrictions for various services.

Deployment tools typically offer release management tools, most notably the ability to roll back to a previous release.

Its `rollback` command makes it easily to quickly roll back to a previous release.

Every release should always have a unique release ID, such as a timestamp of the release (such as `2011-04-06-20:32:17`) or an incrementing number (such as `v100`).
