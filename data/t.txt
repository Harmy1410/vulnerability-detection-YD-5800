fixed bug in ios framework target causing a framework bundle not to be produced issue 48 ‚Äì thanks amosavian
zebus is peer to peer so it does not depend on a broker to dispatch messages between the peers this allows it to reach a throughput of 80k msg s and a roundtrip latency under 500¬µs
the second goal implies a major design choice the actual logging is completely asynchronous it means that writing messages to the appenders obviously occurs in a background thread but also that all formatting operations are delayed to be performed just before the appending no formatting occurs in the calling thread the log data is merely marshalled to the background logging thread in the more efficient way possible
zerolog is a zero allocation net logging library it uses the excellent formatting library stringformatter https github com mikepopoloski stringformatter

when using swagger ui you have to provide the url to which you want to call from your front end to retrieve the api docs until now 05 09 2014 the value where the docs are searched for is fixed so either you have to provide it yourself manually or you can create a resource that will be picked up by your resource resolvers for spring boot for example in resources static folder

this post describes several d3 quantitative scales d3 wiki linear quantize quantile and threshold walking through how they work and the trade offs involved when using them to display colors
while the quantize scale makes intuitive sense and is simple to implement skewed data or outliers can totally alter the color scale here a few very large values stretch out the scale compressing the rest of the values into one color bucket which results in a map with just two colors visual differences between lower values are erased and the two colors that remain don t intrinsically communicate anything about the proportions between the values they represent
here there are 70 values and 5 colors so each bucket has 14 values in it the first bucket has 14 lowest values which are colored the lightest shade of purple the second contains the 15th through 29th lowest values and so one on the scatter plot the previously horizontal bars are now vertical as the colors of each place is determined by its rank not value
the jenks natural breaks algorithm uses dynamic programing to find groupings of value so that the difference of values within a group are minimized the breaks for our population of values are calculated and after light manipulation passed to domain of a threshold scale each break in the domain is matched with a color in the range values are colored based on the largest break which they are smaller than like the quantize scale the horizontal rectangles show where the breaks occur

a set of points convex hull http www cs uu nl geobook introduction pdf is the smallest convex polygon that covers every point if we picture each point as a peg in a board we could approximate the convex hull by stretching a rubber band around all of the points and then letting it pull itself taut against the outer ones
unfortunately computers don t typically come with rubber bands and peg boards so we ll need a different approach to programmatically find a set of points convex hull
since each edge of the convex hull lies between two points from our set we can find the convex hull by iterating over each pair of points and checking to see if it lies on the hull to check the number of points to the left and right blue and red of the line formed by the pair are counted if all the points aren t on the same side that pair can t be an edge of a convex http mathworld wolfram com convex html shape
using canvas instead of svg would be have allowed this to handle many more points before slowing the page down i m not sure how to do that and preserve the simplicity at the heart of the current code https github com 1wheel roadtolarissa blob master source javascripts posts dragoncurve script js

if function composition doesn t scare you then yes i think so i believe using higher order component helpers leads to smaller more focused components and provides a better programming model than using classes for operations‚Äîlike mapprops or shouldupdate ‚Äîthat aren t inherently class y
that being said any abstraction over an existing api is going to come with trade offs there is a performance overhead when introducing a new component to the tree i suspect this cost is negligible compared to the gains achieved by blocking subtrees from re rendering using shouldcomponentupdate ‚Äîwhich recompose makes easy with its shouldupdate and onlyupdateforkeys helpers in the future i ll work on some benchmarks so we know what we re dealing with

one option to help with colour accessibility would be to design with colours people with colour blindness can tell the difference between there are lots of tools for this very purpose available for free on the web and as browser extensions some popular examples include
using them is pretty simple you take your web page or other interface and run it through the tool the tools pick out colours that are common in one type of colour blindness like red and green then the tool will replace the affected colours with one colour this allows you to see the view the way someone with that type of colour blindness might

searching the entire directory structure for files to copy based on file extensions is not optimal with large directory structures if we know what non template static content we want to appear in our output we can opt in to specify files or directories for eleventy to copy this will probably speed up your build times these entries are relative to the root of your project and not your eleventy input directory

you may want to schedule jobs every minute hour day like a distributed cron job there are a number of excellent node packages to help you with this like node schedule https github com tejasmanohar node schedule and node cron https github com ncb000gt node cron actionhero exposes node resque s https github com taskrabbit node resque scheduler to you so you can use the scheduler package of your choice
assuming you are running actionhero across multiple machines you will need to ensure that only one of your processes is actually scheduling the jobs to help you with this you can inspect which of the scheduler processes is correctly acting as master and flag only the master scheduler process to run the schedule an initializer for this docs core initializers html would look like

sometimes a worker crashes is a severe way and it doesn t get the time chance to notify redis that it is leaving the pool this happens all the time on paas providers like heroku when this happens you will not only need to extract the job from the now zombie worker s working on status but also remove the stuck worker to aid you in these edge cases queue cleanoldworkers age callback is available
because there are no heartbeats in resque it is impossible for the application to know if a worker has been working on a long job or it is dead you are required to provide an age for how long a worker has been working and all those older than that age will be removed and the job they are working on moved to the error queue where you can then use queue retryandremovefailed to re enqueue the job

the default behavior can be overridden by individual providers
sometimes the middleware has to be configurable just like you pass roles array to the authorized decorator authorization md in that case you should create a simple middleware factory a function that takes your configuration as a parameters and returns a middleware that use that provided value
you can also attach the resolver to objecttype fields the same way as with authorized decorator authorization md
will be invoked whether the query is rejected or not
returned a value we can define the default value for fields not explicitly annotated
the only difference is that we have to let typegraphql know that this objecttype is implementing the interfacetype we do it by passing the param implements iperson to the decorator if we implemented more interfaces we would pass the array of interfaces like implements iperson ianimal imachine
then your resolvers will be able to declare their dependencies and typegraphql will use the container to solve them
should i implement a field s resolver as a object type s getter method or as a resolver class s method
the biggest problem is the redundancy in our codebase that makes difficult to keep this things in sync to add new field to our entity we have to jump through all the files modify entity class then modify part of the schema and then update the interface the same goes with inputs or arguments it s easy to forget to update one or make a mistake with the type also what if we ve made a typo in field name the rename feature f2 won t work correctly
in config object we can also provide description and deprecationreason for graphql schema purposes
and that s why typegraphql has built in support for validation of arguments and inputs using class validator https github com typestack class validator features you can use awesomeness of decorators to declare the requirement for incoming data e g number is in range 0 255 or password is longer than 8 chars in an easy way
the main idea of typegraphql is to automatically create graphql schema definition from typescript s classes to avoid the need of schema definition files and interfaces describing the schema we use a bit of reflection magic and decorators
we can use the destructuring syntax to have access to single arguments as variables instead of the reference to the whole args object

middlewares are a piece of reusable code that can be easily attached to resolvers and fields by using middlewares you can extract the common used code from your resolvers and then just declaratively attach it using decorator or even register globally
in object oriented programming it is common to create interfaces which describes the contract that classes implementing them has to fulfill we also compose the classes using inheritance mechanism hence typegraphql support both graphql interfaces as well as composing types definition by extending the classes
all you need to do is to implement a middlewareinterface your class has to have the use method that conforms with middlewarefn signature below you can see how the defined earlier logaccess middleware looks after the transformation
however for common middlewares like measuring resolving time or catching errors it might be a tedious work to place usemiddleware resolvetime decorator on every field resolver
hence in typegraphql you can also register a global middleware that will be called for each query mutation subscription and field resolver to do this you have to use globalmiddlewares property of buildschema configuration object
graphql s mutations we can create analogously by declaring the class method using mutation decorator providing return type if needed creating arguments etc but for mutation we usually use input types hence typegraphql allows you to create inputs in the same way as the object types types and fields md but using inputtype decorator
ok but what are newrecipeinput and recipesargs they are of course classes
we can also leverage typescript type checking system and ensure that we won t accidentally change the type of property by implementing partial type
after that we can use the addrecipeinput type in our mutation we can do this inline using arg decorator or as a field of the args class like in query s example above
this code samples are made up just for tutorial docs purpose
first what we have to do is to decorate the class with e g objecttype decorator it marks the class as the type known from graphql sdl or graphqlobjecttype from graphql js

researchers have been trying to endow machines with these human capabilities since antiquity the wikipedia article on the history of artificial intelligence https en wikipedia org wiki history of artificial intelligence describes some of the early attempts but most historians would date the beginning of ai as we know it today to the dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence https en wikipedia org wiki dartmouth workshop over the summer of 1956
if classical ai was about very smart researchers creating rules attempting to understand the world modern ai techniques focus on letting computers derive their own rules using lots and lots of data rather than explicitly telling a computer how to find a cat we ll just show the computer lots of examples of cats and see if the computer can construct a cat detector by figuring out what differentiates cats from dogs or muffins or couches or motorcycles
we ve written the survey specifically as a starting place for for business and technical people just beginning their own journeys with artificial intelligence software engineers yes but also product managers consultants business analysts data scientists even the ai curious line of business owner or executive think of this as a docent led tour of the most popular tools to ai enable your aplications
along the way we re discover software that will help you understand if your customers are excited sad or disgusted by your products we ll see how simple api calls can identify what objects are in an image we ll show how to build your own iphone app that can tell you whether you re pointing your camera at a business card

consumers of xdm can use the json ld context as part of their systems but in practice everything will work just as well when treating everything simply as json
by default all adobe apis that are using xdm are passing the json ld context the mapping between namespace prefix and urls through an http link header as described in section 4 9 of the json ld specification interpreting json as json ld https json ld org spec latest json ld interpreting json as json ld
this ensures that no matter who is generating an xdm document or how the xdm document is being generated conflicting properties can not be introduced
not all xdm schemas are extensible and allow new derivative schemas
an xdm producer that wishes to extend an existing xdm schema has to adhere to the following steps
integer fields are interpreted as the smallest integer data type that can contain the specified range for example if a dayofmonth field has a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 31 it will be interpreted as a byte xdm type

while expressed using json schema xdm is intended to be an abstract model for data that might be physically stored or transmitted in any number of ways depending on the technology in use and the needs of the application
a specific case where this is useful is for representing keyed maps in xdm which are objects for which the set of property keys are not fully known at schema authoring time see below for details
the xdm abstract model for data inherits several properties from json and json schema including the basic type system one ramification of this is that objects in xdm are semantically equivalent to maps in xdm objects are defined as maps from a valid json ld property a full uri a compact uri the keywords id type etc to any xdm defined value

a frame ships with a handful of primitives for common use cases such as displaying basic geometric primitives 3d models and media assets
note that primitives are a helper layer on top of a frame s core api thus it is still extremely valuable to grasp the following
a lot of the primitives represent geometric meshes i e shapes with an appearance thus many of them inherit the common mesh attributes mesh attributes md so while attributes such as color or src are not listed in the attributes table for primitives such as a box a box md or a plane a plane md they are there remember to refer to common mesh attributes table when noted
codepen codepen is a playground for front end web development we can edit html and javascript directly in the browser with their text editor see changes live and share code snippets this is a fast way to dive in without having to download or install anything check out the official mozvr codepens http codepen io team mozvr and the a frame hello world codepen codepen
for more advanced users who want to use their own build steps we can install through npm
then we can just require a frame from our app perhaps built with browserify or webpack

xdm only supports 1 and 3 because the introduction of new values for existing properties can cause challenges for implementers of xdm and increases the difficulty of adhering of xdm s purely additive versioning requirement
the following sections will describe how each of these extension mechanisms can be used by xdm providers that are seeking to extend xdm
1 standard properties are part of the xdm specification and follow a pattern of prefix name for instance repo assetid is the unique identifier of assets in xdm
2 extension properties are not part of the xdm specification and have been defined by a customer a partner or by adobe for things that are specific to one implementation extension property names are always uris like http example com ns xdm my property
however for xdm producers that do not use the link header and instead embed a context in the json document additional rules apply through the extensibility schema fragment xdm ensures that no prefix mappings can be established other than the prefix mappings that are part of the xdm standard
an xdm producer that wishes to extend an existing xdm schema has to adhere to following steps
when used in this document a schema is a json schema as defined by the json schema core specification http json schema org latest json schema core html
