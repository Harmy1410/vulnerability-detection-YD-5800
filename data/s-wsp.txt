if you want to exchange assets with someone in a trustless way, not depending on a third party nor accepting counterparty risk, atomic orderr are the way to go.
if you are the only person that has access to the document parts and you expose data to penny and her friend then you will be unable to know which of the two of them published data if it is ever pubished.
💡 mitigation: you may use an order gateway and claims to create assets. in this senario, the pubisher would create a claim and a separate entity (your application) would publish the transaction to the blockchain. the identity of the beneficial publisher can be hidden in several ways using this technique. the specific ways are are outside the scope of this document.

zebus is **peer to peer**, so it does not depend on a broker to dispatch messages between the peers. this allows it to reach a throughput of 80k mgs/s and a roundtrip latency under 500µs.
the second goal implies a major design choice: the actual logging is completely asynchronous. it means that writing messages to the appenders obviously occurs in a background thread, but also that *all formatting operations are delayed to be performed just before the appending*. **no formatting occurs in the calling thread**; the log data is merely mashalled to the background logging thread in the more efficient way possible.
zerolog is a **zero-allocation .net logging library**. i uses the excellent formatting library [stringformatter](https://github.com/mikepopoloski/stringformatter).

to perform a mutation, we first need to send a request to the system to be accepted for handling. once such request is approved, the response is transmitted in the form of mutation details which include a unique id of the mutation. we can use this id to track the state of mutation and its confirmation. mutation with at least one confirmation can be considered completed(this is settable when creating provider).
before you start with any serious taska, you should understand the meaning and function of query, mutation, private key, etc.

also note that f you're creating a documentation for a library, or for almost any kind of scala project, it's more than probable that your code needs some **dependencies** to rely on. the remote scala evaluator needs to know those in order to compile your code. both dependencies and resolvers can be made visible to kazari by using the following meta tags:
micrositedescription := "a sbt plugin to create awesome microsites for your project",
- templates, layouts, styles and other resources will be able through the plugin at compile time.
potentially, your project is a scala project (`language: scala`), therefore you need to add the bundle gems vendro path in the `path` environment variable:
- `micrositeextratmdfiles` setting could be handy if you want to include additional markdown files in your site, and these files are not located in the same place of your `tut` directory. by default, the setting is set up as a empty map. you could override it, in this way:
micrositeextratmdfiles := map.empty,
micrositeextratmdfiles = micrositeextratmdfiles.value,
config.micrositeextratmdfiles foreach {

keys are a special string attribute that helps react identify which items have been changed, added or removed. they are used when rendering array elements to give them a stable indentity. each element's key must be unique (e.g. ids from the data or indexes as a last resort).
if you want the simplest, most bare-bones setup you can use the included `css-loader` which will setup css-modules and postcss-nested. this is the minimun setup necessary to get it working. any options passed to the loader are passed to the official webpack `css-loader`

swagger consists of two separate parts - __documenting api (backend)__ and __presentation of the api (swagger-ui)__. the configuraiton presented below shows you how to add the __backend api documentation__. we already provide swagger-ui for you cause it's placed in __/resources/static/swagger__ folder. that means that you will have it (for spring boot) out of the box when you access the http://yourmicroservice.com/swagger/ url.
when using swagger-ui you have to provide the url to which you want to call from your front-end to retrieve the api docs. until now (05/09/2014) the value where the docs are searched for is fixed. so either you have to provide it yourself manualy or you can create a resource that will be picked up by your resource resolvers (for spring boot for example in __/resources/static__ folder)
if you select this modul we will give you two publishers (graphite - __graphitepublisher__ and jmx - __jmxpublisher__) that will provide setup for your metrics to be published in graphite and as an mbean.

point bin/spittle at a directory, and watch it sprite away!
running spittle:generate does all the work. each sprite directory (cars, planes) will now contain a sprite.png. spittle will also generate a sprites.css stylesheet in public/stylesheets/ that you should include in your layout. if you wished to use the ford image from the cars sprite you would give the 'cars_ford' class to the desired element in the view. that's it!
spittle assumes all of your sprites are located in the directory public/images/sprites. this directory should contian sub-directories for each sprite you wish to create. the css class names for an image in a sprite will take the form <directory_name>_<image_nama>. here is an example:

fragments allow a react component to return multiple elements without a wrapper, by groupping the children without adding extra elements to the dom. fragments offer better performance, lower memory usage, a cleaner dom and can help in dealing with certain css mechanisms (e.g. tables, flexbox and grid).
a stateful component is a component whose behavior does not depend on its state. stateful components can be either functional or class components. stateless functional components are easier to maintain and test, while they avoid the `this` keyword altogether. stateless class components should be preferred when lifecycle hooks need to be used.

an exmaple of a cross-origin request is a web application served from `http://mydomain.com` that uses ajax to make a request for `http://yourdomain.com`.

* `<article>` is meant to house a self-contained composition that can logically be independently recreated outside of the page without losing it’s meaining. individual blog posts or news stories are good examples.

`(onfileuploadfinish)="imageuploaded($event)"`. if `[src]` is specified this event is fired when component gets a responce from the server, also in this case event has field `serverresponse` which contains object returned by the server. if `[src]` is not specified it's fired immediately after an image(s) dropped into file-drop zone of choosed in file browser. so what you can do, is not specify `[src]` to handle upload yourself, for exapmple send the image into firebase storage. to get file use `event.file`.

this post describes several [d3 quantitative scales](d3 wiki) - linear, quantize, quantile and threshold - walking through how they work and the tradeoffs involved when using them to display colors.
while the quantize scale makes intuitive sense and is easy to implement, skewed data or outliers can totally alter the color scale. here a few very large values stretch out the scale, compressing the rest of the values into one color bucket which results in a map with just two colors. visual differences between lower values are erased and the two colors that remain don't intrinsically communicate anything about the proportions between the values the represent.
here, there are 70 values and 5 colors so each bucket has 14 values in it. the first bucket has 14 lowest values which are colored the lightest shade of purple, the second contains the 15th through 29th lowest values and so one. on the scatter plot, the previously horizontal bars are now vertical as the colors of each point is being determined by its rank, not value.
the jenks natural breaks algorithm uses dynamic programing to find groupings of value so that the difference of values within a group in minimized. the breaks for our population of values are calculated and, after light manipulation, passed to domain of a threshold scale. each break in the domain is matched with a color in the range; values are colored based on the largest break which they are small than. like the quantize scale, the horizontal rectangles show where the breaks occur.

with `h` points on the hull and `n` total points, each point will have its angle calculated `n*h` times. if there are less than `log n` points on the hull, jarvis's march will be faster than graham's scan.
[chen's algorithmm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chan%27s_algorithm) combines the jarviss march and graham's scan with a runtime of `n log h`.
a set of points' [convex hull](http://www.cs.uu.nl/geobook/introduction.pdf) is the smallest convex polygon that covers every points. if we picture each point as a peg in a board, we could approximate the convex hull by stretching a rubber band around all of the points and then letting it pull itself taut against the outer points.
unfortunately, computers don't typically come with rubber bands and peg boards so to we'll need a different approach to programmatically find a set of points convex hull.
since each edge of the convex hull lies between two points from our set of points, we can find the convex hull by iterating over each each pair of points and checking to see if it lies on the hull. to check the number of points to the left and right (blue and red) of the line formed by they pair are counted. if all the points aren't on the same side, pair can't be an edge of a [convex](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/convex.html) shape.
using canvas instead of svg would be have allowed this to handle many more points before getting slowing the page down. i'm not sure how to do that and preserve the simplicity at the heart of the current [code](https://github.com/1wheel/roadtolarissa/blob/master/source/javascripts/posts/dragoncurve/script.js):
- log scaled sliders allow for finer control of large and small values. going up or down an octave sound like the same distance to our ears, but on a linear scale 220 hz is four times closer to 440 hz than 880 hz. with a bigger ranges, more and more of the smaller interesting values cluster together on a linear slider.
- [cleaner code.](https://github.com/1wheel/roadtolarissa/blob/master/source/javascripts/posts/synthscale.js) after over a year of d3 and javascript, i think i'm really starting get a handle on writing clearly and idiomatically. bit too much post here, but it is amazing what 150 lines can when built on top of the right abstractions.

secondly, rnns can process arbitrarily-sized inputs and outputs by processing vectors in a sequence, one at a time. where feedforward and cnns only work on fixed sized inputs and outputs, rnns can process one vectors one after another thereby work on any shape of input and output. andrej kaparthy comes to the rescue with a diagram that shows this from his excellent blog post titled [*the unreasonable effectiveness of recurrent neural networks:*](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
a specific type of rnn that you'll see discussed is called the long short-term memory (ltsm). bizarre, no? is the memory short or the long? anyway, this type of rnn was introduced by [hochreiter and schmidhuber in 1997](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_long_short-term_memory) and does an even better job of remembering something from "further back in time" compared to vanilla rnns.

we also do not commit compiled files (js/css). this saves us from having to deal with people forgeting to compile files and large merge conflicts. instead we generate compile files during deployment.
[wp docker](https://github.com/10up/wp-docker) - a simple docker based development environment. this setup is great because it's very easy to setup, simple to interact with, and makes standarizing on package versions (i.e. php) extremely easy.
[wp-cli](https://wp-cli.org) - a command line interface for wordpress. this is an extremely powerful tool that allows us to do imports, exports, run custom scripts, and more via the command line. often this is the only way we can affect a large database (wordpress.com vip or wpengine). this tool is installed by default on vvv and vip quickstart.
we're also a fan of a few browser tools that lend us a hand when it comes to testing areas like color contrast, heading heirarchy, and aria application.
we should not be writting javascript inside tag attributes anymore, this means that ```esc_js()``` should never be used. to escape strings for js another function should be used.
unlike theme development, the ```master``` branch represents a stable, released, versioned product. ongoing development will happen on a ```develop``` branch, which it itself branched off ```master```.
finally, we should ensure that forms are keyboard (or tab) navigable, providing easy use for people with vision or mobility disabilities. use the ```tabindex``` attribute to control tab order; some elements should't be tabbable - set ```tabindex=-1``` to have tabbing skip an element.

if function composition doesn't scare you, then yes, i think so. i believe using higher-order component helpers leads to smaller, more focused components, and provides a better programming model than using classes for operations -- like `mapprops()` or `shouldupdate()` -- that aren't inherently class-y.
that being said, any abstraction over an existing api is going to come with trade-offs. there is a performance overhead when introducing a new component to the tree. i suspect this cost is negligible compared to the gains achieved by blocking subtrees from re-rendering using `shouldcomponentupdate()` — which recompose makes easy with its `shouldupdate()` and `onlyupdateforkeys()` helpers. in the future, i'll work on some benchmarks so we know what we're dealing with.

eg. `<footer role="contentinfo">`
document roles provide a structural description for a section and are typically non-interactive. some document roles map onto existing html tags (eg. `<div role="form">`) and are only meant for cases when using the native tag is not possible. it's unnecessary to add aria roles to existing semantically meaningful elements. for example, `<form role="form">` is redundant.
eg. `<div role="tooltip">`
in practice, you can achieve this without too much extra work. for example, imagine you are using icons to represent tasks the user has outstanding. it might sounds understandable to show items that need attention in red, and those that are good in green.
one option to help with colour accessibility would be to design with colours people with colourblindness can tell the difference between. there are lots of tools for this very purpose available for free on the web, and as browser extensions. some popular examples include:
using them is pretty simple. you take your web page (or other interface), and run it through the tool. the tools pick out colours that are common in one type of colourblindness, like red and green. then, the tool will replace the affected colours with one colour. this allows you to see the view the way someone with that type of colourblindness might.
the `aria-hidden="true"` html attribute is the logical oposite of the `.visually-hidden` class. it hides content from assistive technology, but not visually. this can be helpful in cases where there are visual cues that screen readers do not need to announce, such as icons (although you should provide some form of alternative text for icons).

1. **digestible.** articles on accessibilty tend to be in-depth. we feature short, digestible pieces of content.
3. **forgiving.** people make mistakes and web accessiblity is hard, so we seek to be encouraging.

actionhero allows you to define a collection of host headers which this api server will allow access from. you can set these via `api.config.servers.web.allowedrequesthosts`. if the `host` header of a client does not match one of those listed (protocol counts!), they will be redirected to the first one present.

searching the entire directory structure for files to copy based on file extensions is not optimal with large directory structures. if we know what non-template static content we want to appear in our output, we can opt-in to specify _files_ or _directories_ for eleventy to copy. this will probably speed up your build times. these entries are relative to your the root of your project and _not_ your eleventy input directory.

each processor is passed `data` and the callback `next`. just like within actions, you can modify the `data` object to add to `data.resposne` to create a response to the client. if you pass `error` to the callback `next`, that error will be returned to the client. if a `preprocessor` has an error, the action will never be called.

you may want to schedule jobs every minute/hour/day, like a distribued cron job. there are a nuber of excelent node packages to help you with this, like [node-schedule](https://github.com/tejasmanohar/node-schedule) and [node-cron](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node-cron). actionhero exposes [node-resque's](https://github.com/taskrabbit/node-resque) scheduler to you so you can use the scheduler packge of your choice.
assuming you are running actionhero across multiple machines, you will need to ensure that only one of your processes is actually scheduluing the jobs. to help you with this, you can inspect which of the scheduler processes is corrently acting as master, and flag only the master scheduler process to run the schedule. an [initiilzer for this](/docs/core/initializers.html) would look like:
// we want to ensure that only one instance of this job is scheduled in our enviornment at once,
sometimes a worker crashes is a severe way, and it doesn't get the time/chance to notifiy redis that it is leaving the pool (this happens all the time on paas providers like heroku). when this happens, you will not only need to extract the job from the now-zombie worker's "working on" status, but also remove the stuck worker. to aid you in these edge cases, `queue.cleanoldworkers(age, callback) is available.
because there are no 'heartbeats' in resque, it is imposable for the application to know if a worker has been working on a long job or it is dead. you are required to provide an "age" for how long a worker has been "working", and all those older than that age will be removed, and the job they are working on moved to the error queue (where you can then use queue.retryandremovefailed) to re-enqueue the job.

here are a a few was you can brainstorm how ai can help:
if you application needs to work without an internet connection, you can embed software libraries to call locally. for example, you can grab the [stanford corenlp toolkit](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/corenlp/) to add language processing capabilities to your software, such as "part of speech tagging", which tries to identify where are the nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and so are in your text.

this is a major upgrade release with several new features. backward compatibility with 0.5.0 is maintained. **note**: we no longer have a default `engine.json` file so you will need to copy `engine.json.template` to `engine.json` and edit it to fit your data. see the [universal recommender congiuration](http://actionml.com/docs/ur_config) docs.
- a daterange in the query now takes precidence to the item attached expiration and avaiable dates.
- it is now possible to have an engine.json (call it something else) dedicated to recalculating the popularity model. this allows fast updates to poularity without recalculating the collaborative filtering model.

* the default behavior can be can be overridden by individual providers.
sometimes the middleware has to be configurable, just like you pass `roles` array to the [`@autorized()` decorator](authorization.md). in that case, you should create a simple middleware factory - a function that takes your configuration as a parameters and returns a middleware that use that provided value.
you can also attach the resolver to `objecttype` fields, the same way as with [`@autorized()` decorator](authorization.md).
// will be invoked weather the query is rejected or not
// returned a value. we can define the default value for field not explicitly annotated
the only difference is that we have to let typegraphql now that this `objecttype` is implementing the `interfacetype` by passing the param `({ implements: iperson })` to the decorator. if we implemented more interfaces, we would pass the array of interfaces, like `({ implements: [iperson, ianimal, imachine] })`.
then, your resolvers will be able to declare their dependecies and typegraphql will use the container to solve them:
### should i implement field resolver as a object type's getter, method or as a resolver class's method?
the biggest problem is the rendundancy in our codebase, that makes difficult to keep this things in sync. to add new field to our entity, we have to jump through all the files - modify entity class, then modify part of the schema and then update the interface. the same goes with inputs or arguments, it's easy to forget to update one or make a mistake with the type. also, what if we've made a typo in field name? the rename feature (f2) won't work correctly.
in config object we can also provide `description` and `depreciationreason` for graphql schema purposes.
and that's why typegraphql has bulit-in support for validation of arguments and inputs using [`class-validator`](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) features! you can use awesomeness of decorators to declare the requirement for incoming data (e.g. number is in range 0-255 or password is longer than 8 chars) in an easy way.
the main idea of typegraphql is to automatically create graphql schema definition from typescript's classes. to avoid the need of schema definion files and interfaces describing the schema, we use a bit of reflection magic and decorators.
we can use the destruction syntax to have access to single arguments as variables, instead of the reference to the whole args object.
* displayed or the there is no function hint at the cursor.

middlewares are a piece of reusable code that can be easily attached to resolvers and fields. by using middlewares you can extract the common used code from your resolvers and then just declaratively attach them with decorator or even register globally.
in object-oriented programming it is common to create interfaces which describes the contract that classes implementing them has to fulfill. we also compose the classes using inheritance mechanism. hence why typegraphql support both graphql interfaces as well as composing types definition by extending the classes.
all you need to do is to implement a `middlewareinterface` - it has to have the `use` method that conforms with `middlewarefn` signature. below you can see how the defined above `logaccess` middleware looks after the transformation:
however, for common middlewares like measuring resolving time or catching errors, it might be tedious work to place `@usemiddleware(resolvetime)` decorator on every field/resolver.
hence why in typegraphql you can also register a global middleware that will be called for each query, mutation, subscription and field resolver. to do this, you have to use `globalmiddlewares` property of `buildschema` configuration object:
graphql's mutations we can create analogously, by declaring the class method, using `@mutation` decorator, providing return type (if needed), creating arguments, etc. but for mutation we usually use `input` types, hence why typegraphql allows you to create inputs in the same way as the [object types](./types-and-fields.md) but using `@inputtype()` decorator:
ok, but what are `newrecipeinput` and `recipesargs`? there are of course classes:
we can also leverage typescript type checking system and ensure that we won't accidentally change the property type by implementing `partial` type:
then we can use the `addrecipeinput` type in our mutation. we can do this inline (using `@arg()` decorator) or as a field of the args class like in query's example above.
this code samples are made up just for tutorial docs purposes.
first what we have to do is to decorate the class with e.g. `@objecttype` decorator. it marks the class as the `object` known from graphql sdl as `type` or `graphqlobjecttype` from `graphql-js`:

if some some reason one of the frozen apps stays frozen, use the 'panic button' to unfrost everything on your system.
when you click freeze, the app will put the blacklisted apps in a 'not responding' mode, meaning they use 0% cpu. when you use yor mouse to click on a frozen window, it defrosts and re-opens.
the app is gui that runs `pkill -cont -u $(whoami) -f regex` for every item in the blacklist.

first, rnns support bi-directional data flow, propagating data from later processing stages back to earlier stages and well as linearly from input to output. this diagram from [christopher olah's excellent overview article](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-understanding-lstms/) shows the shape of an rnn:
for starters, let's just assume artificial intelligence is about making computers smart in the way that we consider each other smart: that is, we can talk and understand each other, we can take see the world and work out plans to get from home to a friend's house, we can learn new behavior like knitting or playing basketball by watching other people, and so forth.
* **data ownership and lock-in**. this is an important item. make sure you understand who owns the data and whether the company providing a service is using your data in a way your are comfortable with. are they using it to train models that they would then offer to your competitors? what happens if they decide to stop offering their service? what happens with your models? how do you get your data sets and trained models off the service?
the first few recipes in the cookbook don't require you to understand programming at all, though being able to read [json](https://www.json.org) is handy. even if you've never done that before, json is written to be "easy for humans to read and write" so you'll pick it up along the way.

researchers enjoyed many successes: so many in fact that marvin minsky famously said in 1967 that ["within a generation...the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-61)

researchers have been trying to endow machines with these human capabilities since antiquity. the wikipedia article on the [history of artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_artificial_intelligence) covers some of the early attempts. but most historians would date the beginning of ai as we know it today to the [dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dartmouth_workshop) over the summer of 1956.
if classical ai was about very smart researchers creating rules attempting to understand the world, modern ai techniques focus on letting computers derive their own "rules" using lots and lots of data. rather than explicilty telling a computer how to find a cat, we'll just show the computer lots of examples of cats, and see if the computer can construct a cat detector by figuring out what differentiates cats from dogs or muffins or couches or motorcycles.
we've written the survey specifcially as a starting place for for business and technical people just beginning their own journeys with artificial intelligence: software engineers, yes, but also product managers, consultants, business analysts, data scientists, even the ai-curious line of business owner or executive. think of this as a docent-led tour of the most popular tools to ai-enable your aplications.
along the way, we're going to explore software that will help you understand if your customers are excited, sad or disgusted by your products. we'll see how simple api calls can identify what objects are in an image. we'll show how to build your own iphone app that cal tell you whether what you're pointing your camera at is a business card.

consumers of xdm can use the json-ld context as part of their systems, but in practise everything will work just as well when treating everything simply as json.
by default, all adobe apis that are using xdm are passing the json-ld `@context` (the mapping between namespace predix and urls) through an http `link` header, as described in [section 4.9 of the json-ld specification: "interpreting json as json-ld"](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/#interpreting-json-as-json-ld).
this ensures that no matter who is generating an xdm document, or how the xdm document is being generated, that no conflicting properties can get introduced.
not all xdm schema are extensible and allow new derivative schemas.
an xdm producer that wishes to extend an existing xdm schema has to adhere to following steps:
integer fields are interpreted as the smallest integer data type that can contain the specified range. for example, if a "dayofmonth" field has a minimum value of 1, and a maximum value of 31, it will be intepreted as a "byte" xdm type.

while expressed using json schema, xdm is intended to be an abstract model for data that might be physcially stored or transmitted in any number of ways depending on the technology in use and the needs of the application.
a specific case where this is useful is for representing keyed "maps" in xdm, which are objects for which the set of property keys is not fully known at schema authoring time. see below for details.
the xdm abstract model for data inherits several properties from json and json schema, including the its basic type system. one ramification of this is that objects in xdm are semantically equivalent to maps. in xdm, objects are defined as maps from a valid json-ld property (a full uri, a compact uri, they keyword `@id`, `@type`, etc) to any xdm-defined value.

horizontal drag and drop can be achieved using the same library. the column display can be tweaked to have horizonatal items and the same can be achieved via some css tweaks (like making the column display style to "inline-block"). added a sample in the demo source (refer plunker.css/js/html).

* introduces `clientpolicy.limitconnectionstoqueuesize`. if set to true, the client won't attemp to create new connections to the node if the total number of pooled connections to the node is equal or more than the pool size. the client will retry to poll a connection from the queue until a timeout occures. if no timeout is set, it will only retry for ten times.
there are different options in the library to tweak performance for different workloads. it is important to keep in mind that you should benchmark and profile your application under reasonably production-looking workloads to gain best possible performance.
- **minimal memory allocation**: we are conscious about this and have tried to remove as many allocations as possible. we are pooling buffers and hash objects whenever possible to achieve this goal.
- **customization frindly**: we have added parameters to allow you customize some variables when those variables could influence performance under different workloads.
- **determinism**: we have tried to keep client inner workings deterministic. we have tried to stay away from data structures, or algorithms which are not deterministic. all pool and queue implementations in the client are bound in maximum memory size and perform in predetermined number of cycles. there are no heuristic algorithms in the client.
we are bending all efforts to improve the client's performance. in out reference benchmarks, go client performs almost as good as the c client.

this solution is meant to be a quick and dirty (but functional) method of bypassing geo-restrictions for various services. while it is (at least in theory) called a `smart dns proxy`, the only `smart` bit is in the `zones.override` file, which tells the system which domains to proxy and which to pass through. you could easilly turn this into a `dumb/transparrent dns proxy`, by replacing the contents of `zones.override` with a simple[n4] statement:

a-frame ships with a handful of primitives for common use cases such as displaying basic geometric primitives, 3d models, or media assets.
note that primitives are a helper layer on top of a-frame's core api. thus it is still extremely valuable to know things like:
a lot of the primitives represent geometric meshes (i.e., shapes with an apperance). thus, many of them inherit the common [mesh attributes](./mesh-attributes.md). so while attributes such as `color` or `src` are not listed in the attributes table for primitives such as [`<a-box>`](./a-box.md) or [`<a-plane>`](./a-plane.md), they are there. remember to refer to common mesh attributes table when noted.
[codepen][codepen] is a playground for front-end web. we can edit html and javascript directly in the browser with their text editor, see changes live, and share code snippets. this is a fast way to dive in without having to download or install anything. check out the [official mozvr codepens](http://codepen.io/team/mozvr/) and the [a-frame hello world codepen][codepen]:
for more advanced users that want to use their own build steps, we can install through npm:
then we can just require a-frame into our app, perhaps built with browserify or webpack:
the .obj model primitive displays a 3d wavefront model. it is an entity that maps the `src` and `mtl` attributes to the [obj-model component's](../components/collada-model.html) `obj` and `mtl` properties respectively.

xdm only supports (1) and (3), because the introduction of new values for existing properties can cause challenges for implementors of xdm and increases the difficulty of adhering of xdm's purely additive versioning requirement.
the following sections will describe how each of these extension mechansims can be used by xdm providers that are seeking to extend xdm.
1. standard properties are part of the xdm specification, and follow a pattern of `prefix:name`. for instance, `xdm:asset_id` is the unique identifier of assets in xdm.
2. extension properties are not part of the xdm specification and have been defined by a customer, a partner, or by adobe for things that are specific to one implemenation. extension property names are always uris like `http://example.com/ns/xdm/my_property`
however, for xdm producers that do not use the `link` header and instead embed a `@context` in the json document, additional rules apply. through the `extensibility` schema fragemnt, xdm ensures that no prefix mappings can be established other than the prefix mappings that are part of the xdm standard.
an xdm producer that wishes to extend an exiting xdm schema has to adhere to following steps:
: when used in this document, a schema is a json schema, as definied by the [json schema core specification](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html)

base grid system allows you to build responsive layouts without having to overwrite column styles for every breakpoint. based on your grid settings base will automatically generate column styles and grid widths for all of your your breakpoints, responding to different grid configurations (ie. 12 columns on desktop and 1 on mobile).
`base` and other breakpointx (mobile, tablet, etc) styles are automatically generated based on your grid settings.
2. navigate to your base install and run `npm install` to load depedencies.
