while the quantize scale makes intuitive sense and is easy to implement, skewed data or outliers can totally alter the color scale. here a few very large values stretch out the scale, compressing the rest of the values into one color bucket which results in a map with just two colors. visual differences between lower values are erased and the two colors that remain don't intrinsically communicate anything about the proportions between the values the represent.	while the quantize scale makes intuitive sense and is simple to implement, skewed data or outliers can totally alter the color scale. here a few very large values stretch out the scale, compressing the rest of the values into one color bucket which results in a map with just two colors. visual differences between lower values are erased and the two colors that remain don't intrinsically communicate anything about the proportions between the values they represent.
here, there are 70 values and 5 colors so each bucket has 14 values in it. the first bucket has 14 lowest values which are colored the lightest shade of purple, the second contains the 15th through 29th lowest values and so one. on the scatter plot, the previously horizontal bars are now vertical as the colors of each point is being determined by its rank, not value.	here, there are 70 values and 5 colors so each bucket has 14 values in it. the first bucket has 14 lowest values which are colored the lightest shade of purple, the second contains the 15th through 29th lowest values and so one. on the scatter plot, the previously horizontal bars are now vertical as the colors of each place is determined by its rank, not value.
the jenks natural breaks algorithm uses dynamic programing to find groupings of value so that the difference of values within a group in minimized. the breaks for our population of values are calculated and, after light manipulation, passed to domain of a threshold scale. each break in the domain is matched with a color in the range; values are colored based on the largest break which they are small than. like the quantize scale, the horizontal rectangles show where the breaks occur.	the jenks natural breaks algorithm uses dynamic programing to find groupings of value so that the difference of values within a group are minimized. the breaks for our population of values are calculated and, after light manipulation, passed to domain of a threshold scale. each break in the domain is matched with a color in the range; values are colored based on the largest break which they are smaller than. like the quantize scale, the horizontal rectangles show where the breaks occur.

if function composition doesn't scare you, then yes, i think so. i believe using higher-order component helpers leads to smaller, more focused components, and provides a better programming model than using classes for operations -- like `mapprops()` or `shouldupdate()` -- that aren't inherently class-y.	if function composition doesn't scare you, then yes, i think so. i believe using higher-order component helpers leads to smaller, more focused components, and provides a better programming model than using classes for operations—like `mapprops()` or `shouldupdate()`—that aren't inherently class-y.
that being said, any abstraction over an existing api is going to come with trade-offs. there is a performance overhead when introducing a new component to the tree. i suspect this cost is negligible compared to the gains achieved by blocking subtrees from re-rendering using `shouldcomponentupdate()` — which recompose makes easy with its `shouldupdate()` and `onlyupdateforkeys()` helpers. in the future, i'll work on some benchmarks so we know what we're dealing with.	that being said, any abstraction over an existing api is going to come with trade-offs. there is a performance overhead when introducing a new component to the tree. i suspect this cost is negligible compared to the gains achieved by blocking subtrees from re-rendering using `shouldcomponentupdate()`—which recompose makes easy with its `shouldupdate()` and `onlyupdateforkeys()` helpers. in the future, i'll work on some benchmarks so we know what we're dealing with.

assuming you are running actionhero across multiple machines, you will need to ensure that only one of your processes is actually scheduluing the jobs. to help you with this, you can inspect which of the scheduler processes is corrently acting as master, and flag only the master scheduler process to run the schedule. an [initiilzer for this](/docs/core/initializers.html) would look like:	assuming you are running actionhero across multiple machines, you will need to ensure that only one of your processes is actually scheduling the jobs. to help you with this, you can inspect which of the scheduler processes is correctly acting as master, and flag only the master scheduler process to run the schedule. an [initializer for this](/docs/core/initializers.html) would look like:

because there are no 'heartbeats' in resque, it is imposable for the application to know if a worker has been working on a long job or it is dead. you are required to provide an "age" for how long a worker has been "working", and all those older than that age will be removed, and the job they are working on moved to the error queue (where you can then use queue.retryandremovefailed) to re-enqueue the job.	because there are no 'heartbeats' in resque, it is impossible for the application to know if a worker has been working on a long job or it is dead. you are required to provide an "age" for how long a worker has been "working", and all those older than that age will be removed, and the job they are working on moved to the error queue (where you can then use queue.retryandremovefailed) to re-enqueue the job.
