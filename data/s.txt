the default behavior can be can be overridden by individual providers
you can also attach the resolver to objecttype fields the same way as with autorized decorator authorization md
the only difference is that we have to let typegraphql now that this objecttype is implementing the interfacetype by passing the param implements iperson to the decorator if we implemented more interfaces we would pass the array of interfaces like implements iperson ianimal imachine
and that s why typegraphql has bulit in support for validation of arguments and inputs using class validator https github com typestack class validator features you can use awesomeness of decorators to declare the requirement for incoming data e g number is in range 0 255 or password is longer than 8 chars in an easy way
the main idea of typegraphql is to automatically create graphql schema definition from typescript s classes to avoid the need of schema definion files and interfaces describing the schema we use a bit of reflection magic and decorators
we can use the destruction syntax to have access to single arguments as variables instead of the reference to the whole args object

graphql s mutations we can create analogously by declaring the class method using mutation decorator providing return type if needed creating arguments etc but for mutation we usually use input types hence why typegraphql allows you to create inputs in the same way as the object types types and fields md but using inputtype decorator
first what we have to do is to decorate the class with e g objecttype decorator it marks the class as the object known from graphql sdl as type or graphqlobjecttype from graphql js

data ownership and lock in this is an important item make sure you understand who owns the data and whether the company providing a service is using your data in a way your are comfortable with are they using it to train models that they would then offer to your competitors what happens if they decide to stop offering their service what happens with your models how do you get your data sets and trained models off the service
if we inspire you to try adding some ai to your own software and we hope we do here are a few things to criteria to consider in selecting paid services

warning never start solving problems until you have a thourough understanding of current stakeholder requirements otherwise you risk wasting effort in areas that no influential stakeholder cares about
that carry huge financial technical or organizatitional risks or penylties
whenever you interview stakeholders a thourough preparation will lead to better results interviewers will be less likely to forget important topics

defaults for the application have been optimized for quality rather than performance if you wish to get higher performance out of the application it is recommended you use a less computationally expensive filtering algorithm and a lower jpeg quality for examples add the following to the configuration
in order to secure requests so that third parties cannot easily use the resize service the application can require that requests provide a signature to enable this feature set the client key option the signature is a hexadecimal digest of the concatenation of the query string and the client key using the md5 algorithm the below python code provides an example implementation
to verify that your client application is generating correct signatures use the signature command note as in the example below when verifying signatures the web application will not include the leading question mark from the query string when determinging the signature
