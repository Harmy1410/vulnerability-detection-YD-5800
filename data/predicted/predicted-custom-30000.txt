you must apply the cdb cartodbfytable function to a target table in order to create and display connected datasets in your account this additional step of cartofying data is the process of converting an arbitrary postgresql table into a valid carto table and registering it into the system so that it can be used in the graphical user interface and the carto engine to generate maps and analysis
carto is based on the rock solid postgresql database all of your tables reside a single database which means you can perform complex queries joining tables or carrying out geospatial operations the best place to learn about postgres sql s sql language is the official documentation http www postgressql org docs 9 1 static
carto is also based on postgi so you can view the official postgi reference http postgis refractions net docs to know what functionality we support in terms of geospatial operations all of our tables include a column called the geom which is a geometry field that indexes geometries in the epsg 4326 wgs 1984 coordinate system all tables also have an automatically generated and updated column calledthe geom webmercator we use the column internally to quickly create tiles for maps

using the standard html title attribute works for desktop web browsers but doesn t work for mobile users therefore a better solution is suggested such as using a custom tooltip component which displays itself on mouse over on desktops and on tap on mobile devices an example of such component is tooltip from react responsive ui https catamphetamine github io react reactive ui tooltip
the default tooltip is implemented using the standard html title attribute and displays verbose date label if intl is supported then intl datetimeformat is used for formatting the verbose datetime label otherwise simple date tostring is used
when given future dates format produces the corresponding output e g in 5 minutes in a year etc

having said all that it is definitely possible to drop redux router and rewrite this library with bare react router say 3 x since the new 4 x is a totally another library but currently i see no big reason for doing that it s working fine now no bugs etc the only bug is the onenter hook one but i implemented a workaround for it too see onenter section of this readme

is a module providing support for isomorphic universal rendering with react react router redux redux router also allows for webpack hot reload allows for locale detection and therefore internationalization of the app provides isomorphic http client for rest api also it handles http cookies mutation correctly both on client and server and when paired with redux it knows how to preload web pages when rendering them on the server
instead of passing the cerebral controller to the container you just pass it the state of the application the will render your application in the correct state how you produce this state is up to you though applications are very different related to producing state on the server so there is not one answer here
both react and inferno supports rendering your application on the server but that does not means your application runs on the servers the only thing you need to pre render your application is state the container for your application can also be used to the server to provide state

chefspec aims to provide the easiest and simplest path for new users to write rspec examples for chef cookbooks in doing so it makes some sacrifices in terms of speed and agility of execution in other words chefspec favors speed to develop over speed to execute many of these decisions are directly related to the way chef dynamically loads resources at runtime
because chefspec is a unit testing framework it is recommended that all third party api calls be mocked or stubbed chefspec exposes a helpful rspec macro for stubbing search results in your tests if you converge a chef recipe that implements a search call chefspec will throw an error like

keep a close eye on the scale of the x axis in the phase plane plot and notice again that s g to 0 the hugoniot loci become nearly parallel horizontal in the h u plane this means that their intersection occurs at a very large value of h so the middle state depth goes to infty as g two to 0 meanwhile the speed of both shocks approaches a single value so the region occupied by the middle states gets ever narrower in the limit the solution for the depth involves a delta function
near the point of intersection the curves are very close indeed they must be tangent at this point since their direction is parallel to the corresponding eigenvector there far from this point they diverge for small depths they must diverge greatly since the hugoniot locus never reaches h 0 at any finite depth

then if we constrain both horizontal edges but leave at least one of the vertical edges unconstrained then we make the height dependent on the width and changing the width will also change the height while maintaining the aspect ratio
now that a chain is set up all we need to do is apply weights to individual views within the chain this can be done by setting the view s layout width to either match constraint or 0dp they are the same thing and then applying a weight in this case we use a horizontal weight because it is a horizontal chain
now that a chain is set up all we need to do is apply weights to individual views within the chain this can be done by setting the view s layout width to either match constraint or 0dp they are the same thing and then applying a weight in this case we use a horizontal weight because it is a horizontal chain
the final use case of percentlayout that we ll cover is how to make the height of a view a function of its width or vice versa there is a much fuller explanation of how this works in constraintlayout here basics dimensions md we specify a ratio of the view and ensure that both the android layout width and android layout height are set to match constraint or 0dp

however in practice people prefer to express the update to look as similar to vanilla sgd or to the previous momentum update as possible this is possible to achieve by manipulating the update above with a variable transform x head x mu v and then expressing the update in terms of x ahead instead of x that is the parameter vector we are actually storing is always the ahead version the equations in termsof x ahead but renaming it back to x then become
in practice we find that the step decay dropout is slightly preferable because the hyperparameters it involves the fraction of decay and the step timings in units of epochs are more interpretable than the hyper parameter k lastly if you can afford the computational budget err on the side of slower decay and train for a longer time
practical issues numeric stability when you re writing code for computing the softmax function in practice the intermediate terms e f y i and sum j e f j may be very large due to the exponentials dividing large numbers can be numerically unstable so it is important to use a normalization trick notice that if we multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by a constant c and push it into the sum we get the following mathematically equivalent expression

in addition to the motivation we provided above there are many desirable properties to including the regularization penalty many of which we will come back to in later sections for example it turns out that including the l2 penalty leads to the appealing max margin property in svms see cs229 http cs229 stanford edu notes cs229 notes3 pdf lecture notes for full details if you are interested
we discussed the tradeoffs between computing the numerical and analytic gradient the numerical gradient is simple but it is approximate and expensive to compute the analytic gradient is exact fast to compute but more error prone since it requires the derivation of the gradient with math hence in practice we always use the analytic grad and then perform a gradient check in which its implementation is compared to to the numerical grad

super sunshine uses the blinn phong shading model to compute the colour of each point in a scene this model breaks down lighting calculations into four independent terms emissivity ambient light diffuse reflection and specular reflection which are added to render the final appearance of a geometric primitive
the second bullet point describes what is known as distance falloff or attenuation which is a phenomenon that you see every day objects that are close to a light source are illuminated brightly while those that are far away are not in nature this reduction of intensity happens quadratically in super sunshine you can choose to have no attenuation or to have it happen in a constant linear or quadratic manner
thankfully we don t have to worry about those equations because a ray tracer s approach to modeling light is very simple what we do have to deal about are the different types of light sources that we can have in a scene as an experiment look around and count the number light sources than you see perhaps you are sitting next to a window and sunlight is pouring in through it maybe there s a lamp close by with a warm light bulb or a few shiny surfaces that reflect the light emitted by other sources
