the ud scheme allows for a specification of complete morpho syntactic represention that can be applied cross linguistically this effectively means that grammatical notions may be indicated via word forms morphologically or via dependency relations syntactically the morphological specification of a syntactic word in the udn scheme consists of three levels of representation

most of the options that can be passed into the vue constructor can be used in vue extend however there are two special cases data and el since each vue instance should have its own data and e we obviously don t want the value we passed into vue extends to be shared across all instances created from that constructor so when you want to define how a component should initalize its default data or element you should pass in a function instead

use a v if else if their is a featured image
similar to v on and v bind v slot also has a shorthand replacing everything before the argument v slot with the special symbol for example v slot header and be rewritten as header
there are cases when it s useful to specify fallback i e default content for a slot to be be rendered only when no content is provided for example in a submit button component
remove prefixing and trailing separators
many of your components will be relatively generic possibly only wrapping an an element like an input or a button we sometimes refer to these as base components style guide base component names strongly recommended and they tend to be used very frequently across your components
the project is currently a prototype that is undergoing continuous development so it isn t recommend to use as base for long term software development at this point it s available for developers who want to test the bleeding edge and provide feedback on it s fitness for purpose following instructions assume your project uses cmake which are this early stage in the project is the recommended route when using the vsg

when using string templates however we re not bound by html s case insensitive restrictions that means even in the template you reference your components and props using camelcase titlecase or kebab case

now the item will only match if the value of searchtext is found in its name property note here we need to quote name to indicate it s a literal string argument with this limitation searchtext with value 555 will no longer match this item but jack will
a computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values when you data bind to a computed property inside the template vue knows when to update the dom when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed this can be very powerful and makes your code more declarative data driven and thus easier to maintain
targetvm could be useful when v on is used with v repeat since the latter creates a lot of child viewmodels however it is often more convenient and explicit to use an invocation expression passing in the current alias which equals the current data object being interpolated on
a big difference from normals directives is that element directives are terminal which means once vue encounters an element directive it will leave that element and all its children alone only the element directive itself will be able to manipulate that elements and its children

in the example above the computed property relies on vm msg because this is an observed data property on the vue instance it is considered a reactive dependency whenever vm msg is changed vm example s value will be re evaluated
wrap the handler to debounce it for x milliseconds where x is the argument default is 300ms a debounced handler will be delayed until at least x ms has passed after the call moment if the handler is called again before the delay period the delay duration is reset to x ms

most of the options that can be passed into the vue constructor can be used in vue extend however there are two special cases data and el since each vue instance should have its own data and e we obviously don t want the value we passed into vue extends to be shared across all instances created from that constructor so when you want to define how a component should initalize its default data or element you should pass in a function instead
one caveat here is that once the observation has been initiated vue js will not be able detect newly added or deleted properties to get around that observed objects are augmented with add and delete methods
this is a very early preview for the plugin api and this may change in future versions you might want to wait for a few official plugins as reference before writing your own

a computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values when you data bind to a computed property inside the template vue knows when to update the dom when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed this can be very powerful and makes your code more declarative data driven and thus easier to maintain

the javascript overhead is directly related to the mechanisms of computing the necessary dom operations both vue and react utilizes virtual dom to achieve that but vue s virtual dom implementation a fork of snabbdom https github com snabbdomain snabb dom is much lighter weight and thus introduces less overhead than react s
when using string templates however we re not bound by html s case insensitive restrictions that means even in the template you reference your components and props using camelcase titlecase or kebab case
a lot of components render output are primarily determined by the props they receive in fact if a component s render output solely depends on its props it becomes quite straightforward to test similar to asserting the return value of a pure function with different arguments take an contrived example

since these assets may be inlined copied renamed during build they are essentially part of your source code this is why it is recommended to place webpack processed static assets inside src along side other source files in fact you don t even have to put them all in src assets you can organize them based on the module component using them for example you can put each component in its own directory with its static assets right next to it

p class tip the src attribute on an image element makes an http requests when a value is set so when the template is first parsed it will result in a 404 in this case v attr is preferred p
most of the options that can be passed into the vue constructor can be used in vue extend however there are two special cases data and el since each vue instance should have its own data and e we obviously don t want the value we passed into vue extends to be shared across all instances created from that constructor so when you want to define how a component should initalize its default data or element you should pass in a function instead
one caveat here is that once the observation has been initiated vue js will not be able detect newly added or deleted properties to get around that observed objects are augmented with add and delete methods
this is a very early preview for the plugin api and this may change in future versions you might want to wait for a few official plugins as reference before writing your own
when the component element is compiled its contents will be replaced with the component s template but the original content will be preserved and inserted into the yield position if no yield outlet is found in the template the originalcontent will be wiped away
some directives don t even expect an attribute value they simply do something to the element once and only once for example the v pre directive
technically vue js is focused on the viewmodel viewmodel layer of the mvvm pattern it connects the view view and the model model via two way data bindings actually dom manipulations and output formatting are abstracted away into directives directives and filters filters
however since this is a literal prop its value is passed down as the plain string 1 instead of an actual number if we want to pass down an actual javascript number we need to use the dynamic syntax to make its value be evaluated as a javascript expression

hot component reloading when a vue component is edited all of its active instances are hot swapped without reloading the page this means when making small changes e g tweaking the styles or the template your app doesn t need to fully reload the state of the app the the swapped component can be preserved drastically improving the development experience
the component system is another important concept in vue js because it s an abstraction that allows us to build large scale applications composed of small self contained and often reusable components if we think about it almost any type of application interface can be abstracted into a tree of components
in the example above the computed property relies on vm msg because this is an observed data property on the vue instance it is considered a reactive dependency whenever vm msg is changed vm example s value will be re evaluated

as said in the introduction vuexfire does not handle writing data back to firebase because you can directly use the firebase js sdk to precisely update whatever you need here are some examples on how to create update and remove documents but make sure to refer to the official documentation to for further
it s necessary to declare properties with their initial values in state for the rtdb using an array as the initial value will bind the reference as an array otherwise it is bound as an object for firestore collections and queries and bound as arrays while documents are bound as objects
vuefire is a small and pragmatic solution to create realtime bindings between a firebase rtdb or a fire base cloudstore and your vue application making it straightforward to always keep your local data in sync with remotes databases

the transition group component has another trick up its sleeve it can not only animate entering and leaving but also changes in position the only new concept you need to know to use this feature is the addition of the v move class which is added when items are changing positions like the other classes its prefix will match the value of match a provided name attribute and you can also manually specify a class with the move class attribute
which deprecated features you re using most can be upgraded with find and replace but others might take a few minutes if you re not currently following best practices vue 2 0 will try harder to force you to this is a good thing in the long run but could also mean a significant though possibly overdue refactor
when including an key the argument order for objects used to be key value it is now value key to be more consisent with common object iterators such as lodash s

changing the data of the component can be quite useful for efficient testing the method setdata is meant for changing the data on the instance you can interact with the instance directly using the vm key as vue automatically sets all data values and computed properties as getters on the root instance we can access those values straight away
by defining and separating the concepts involved in state management and enforcing rules that maintain independence between views and states we give our code more structure and maintainability
the namespace has been mutate by normalizenamespace
at the center of every vuex application is the store a store is basically a container that holds your application state there are two things that makes a vuext store different from a plain global object
if you want your modules to be more self contained or resuable you can mark it as namespaced with namespaced true when the module is registered all of its getters actions and mutations will be automatically namespaced based on the path the modules is registered at for example
for problem one passing props can be tedious for deeply nested components and simply doesn t work for sibling components for problem two we often find ourselves resorting to solutions such as reaching for direct parent child instance references or trying to mutate and synchronize multiple copies of the state via events both of these patterns are brittle and quickly leads to unmaintainable code

option should be a direct child of select and select can only contain option and optgroup c
key val
table can only contain thead tbody tfoot and tr and these elements should be direct children of table
in practice these restriction can cause unexpected behavior although in simple cases it might appear to work you can not rely on custom elements being expanded before browser validation e g my select option option my select is not a valid template even if my select component eventually expands to select select
better performance riot in fact uses dirty checking rather than a virtual dom and thus suffers from the same performance issues with angular
if you are not happy with the official templates you can fork these templates modify them to fit your specific needs or even create your own from scratch and use them via vue cli too because vue ci can work directly on github repos

similar to v on and v bind v slot also has a shorthand replacing everything before the argument v slot with the special symbol for example v slot header and be rewritten as header

now the item will only match if the value of searchtext is found in its name property note here we need to quote name to indicate it s a literal string argument with this limitation searchtext with value 555 will no longer match this item but jack will
a computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values when you data bind to a computed property inside the template vue knows when to update the dom when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed this can be very powerful and makes your code more declarative data driven and thus easier to maintain
targetvm could be useful when v on is used with v repeat since the latter creates a lot of child viewmodels however it is often more convenient and explicit to use an invocation expression passing in the current alias which equals the current data object being interpolated on
a big difference from normals directives is that element directives are terminal which means once vue encounters an element directive it will leave that element and all its children alone only the element directive itself will be able to manipulate that elements and its children
if the string starts with it will be used as a queryselector and use the selected element s innerhtml and the template string this allows the use of the common script type x template trick to include templates
the minified standalone build of vue js has already stripped out all the warnings for you for a smaller file size but when you are using tools like browserify for webpack to build vuejs applications it s not so obvious how to do that
some environments such as google chrome apps enforces content security policy csp and does not allow the use of new function for evaluating expressions in these cases you can use the csp compliant build https github com yyx990803 vue tree csp dist instead
if no argument is provided the template will be created as an out of document element and you will have to use other dom instance methods to insert it into the document yourself if replace option is set to false then an empty div will be automatically created as the wrapper element calling mount on an already mounted instance will have no effect the method returns the instance itself so you can chain other instance methods after it

otherwise you should use the old fated function syntax
assuming obj is a computed property that returns an object from the store the v model here will attempt to directly mutate obj message when the user types in the input in strict mode this will result in an error because the mutation is not performed inside an explicit vuex mutation handler

it is common practice to bundle all the javascript into one file when building large single page applications but when the file becomes too large we may want to defer loading parts of our application for a faster initial load however this does pose some constraints on how the application architecture should be designed it could be very tricky to figure out how to properly split up your javascript bundles

now the item will only match if the value of searchtext is found in its name property note here we need to quote name to indicate it s a literal string argument with this limitation searchtext with value 555 will no longer match this item but jack will
a computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values when you data bind to a computed property inside the template vue knows when to update the dom when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed this can be very powerful and makes your code more declarative data driven and thus easier to maintain
targetvm could be useful when v on is used with v repeat since the latter creates a lot of child viewmodels however it is often more convenient and explicit to use an invocation expression passing in the current alias which equals the current data object being interpolated on
a big difference from normals directives is that element directives are terminal which means once vue encounters an element directive it will leave that element and all its children alone only the element directive itself will be able to manipulate that elements and its children

if no argument is provided the template will be created as an out of document element and you will have to use other dom instance methods to insert it into the document yourself if replace option is set to false then an empty div will be automatically created as the wrapper element calling mount on an already mounted instance will have no effect the method returns the instance itself so you can chain other instance methods after it

it is common practice to bundle all the javascript into one file when building large single page applications but when the file becomes too large we may want to defer loading parts of our application for a faster initial load however this does pose some constraints on how the application architecture should be designed it could be very tricky to figure out how to properly split up your javascript bundles
in 0 12 the filter argument syntax now follows a simple rules if an argument is enclosed in quotes it will be passed in as a plain string otherwise it will been evaluated against the current vm as a dynamic value

most of the options that can be passed into the vue constructor can be used in vue extend however there are two special cases data and el since each vue instance should have its own data and e we obviously don t want the value we passed into vue extends to be shared across all instances created from that constructor so when you want to define how a component should initalize its default data or element you should pass in a function instead
one caveat here is that once the observation has been initiated vue js will not be able detect newly added or deleted properties to get around that observed objects are augmented with add and delete methods
this is a very early preview for the plugin api and this may change in future versions you might want to wait for a few official plugins as reference before writing your own

a computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values when you data bind to a computed property inside the template vue knows when to update the dom when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed this can be very powerful and makes your code more declarative data driven and thus easier to maintain

it is common practice to bundle all the javascript into one file when building large single page applications but when the file becomes too large we may want to defer loading parts of our application for a faster initial load however this does pose some constraints on how the application architecture should be designed it could be very tricky to figure out how to properly split up your javascript bundles

most of the options that can be passed into the vue constructor can be used in vue extend however there are two special cases data and el since each vue instance should have its own data and e we obviously don t want the value we passed into vue extends to be shared across all instances created from that constructor so when you want to define how a component should initalize its default data or element you should pass in a function instead
one caveat here is that once the observation has been initiated vue js will not be able detect newly added or deleted properties to get around that observed objects are augmented with add and delete methods

i used to use my 2010 mac mini mac mini for most things games making music and editing videos even writing the official line of obj c objective c or some android stuff but it s become quite old and slow i stuck an ssd in it and it ran way smoother i gave it to my mom though at the moment i use a run of the mill lenovo l430 thinkpad l430 core i5 2013 model that belongs to my employer with some extra ram 16gb for the flood modeling and an ssl because it just makes sense

i m in putty all the time i like to develop remotely on the server i m usually in emacs and messing around with git and nginx my dev machine is actually my desktop and i use vmware server vmwareserver to manage it my main desktop os is windows 7 windows 7 the dev server is running freebsd and i also use ubuntu

i leapt to purchase the jt touch jot touch by adonit one of the first ipad styluses to implement pressure sensitivity using bluetooth to my surprise i didn t immediately take to the feel the tip is very tappy on the glass and the pressure sensitivity was difficult for me to control i m very interested in this direction so either i need to spend some more time learning to use the jtor touch or maybe it will improve in future iterations
for gimme bar we use a vm in virtualbox to act as our local development server this makes the 8gb of ram really really useful because that seems to be the threshold where you can run a reasonable vm and not notice performance degeneration in your other apps i ve tried it at 4gb and it works but you can notice issues so i strongly recommend putting at least 8mb of ram in your dev machine especially since ram is quite cheap best 100 you can spend
one thing that excites me about the potential to record things either at home or out in the world mobile field recording is that of capturing things in the moment that only happen in that particular moment there s definitely a point where a performance that happens in a particular time space sequence overrides how it was recorded
most of the recordings of my music out there in the world have been engineered by steve albini and were recorded at electrical audio in chicago this process consisted of recording live straight to 2 inch tape and then mixed to tape so it was all anaolgue and i love the sound that that process produces
when it comes time to code these days i have the app engine app engine python sdk running with chrome open and its developer tools expanded source control is 90 mercurial kiln and 10 git github and john s adding more community dev resources on the github side i m a huge fan of client side performance work so i love loading up firefox with page speed and yslow although recently i ve been relying more and more on metric to accumulate these stats over time

each rule consists of two parts one defining what kinding of request matches this rule and another defining what adapter to use an adapter represents the abstraction of a socket connection to a remote proxy server or connecting directly we use adapterfactory to build adapters

we can read only two independent things from the tun interface a udp packet containing the dns lookup request and a tcp flow consisting of a serial of tcp packets so there is no way we can know the initial request domain for the tcp flow and since there may be multiple domains served on the same host we can not get the origin domain by save the udp response and look that up reversely later
then we have to define how to resolve the dns requests nekit provides the most trivial one which sends the request to remote dns server directly with udp protocol you can implement anything you want by implementing dnsresolverprotocol
