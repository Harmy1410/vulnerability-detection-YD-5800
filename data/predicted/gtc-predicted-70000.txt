because of the properties that we will show discover the product is also called the sum note that this dual notion is fundamentally different let us see what it means for the category set
in this case the unique arrows q are what gives the product a universal mapping property if a product exists it is unique op to unique isomorphism
the arrow marked with a question marked is an arrow in set arrows in sets are functions which we can define by saying what it does on elements the elements of the hom sets are arrows in mathcal c given some element of text hom c a i e an arrow on mathcal ca g c to a we need to obtain an element of content hom c b i e and arrow from c to b we have the following picture
partically speaking the difficulty in using a typed pure functional programming language is that the functions that you write between types should behave like mathematical functions on the corresponding sets this means for example that if you call a function multiple times with the same arguments it should produce the same result every time this is often summarized as a side effect free function more generally values are in principle immutable
note that implicitely we talk about the component of alpha at a since this function is polymorphic the right component gets picked by the compiler for example say we have a list a and we want to obtain the first element of this list if the list is empty then there is no such element otherwise we obtain an a i e the result is a maybe a

last couple of months the react community started shifting in an interesting direction so far in our examples the children prop was a react component there is however a new pattern gaining popularity in which the same children prop is a jsx expression let s start by passing a simple object

1 it must be a pure function it means that the function should return the exact same output every time when the same input is given
the result of this code is an input element that we can focus but can t change it is never updated because we have a single source of truth the app s component state to make the input works as expected we have to add an onchange handler and update the state the single sourceof truth which will trigger a new rendering cycle and we will see what we typed

react became one of the most popular libraries for building ui it comes with great api which is simple and powerful the tricky part thought is that react itself is not always enough for building complex applications there are concepts that we have to know to make it right design patterns that are introduced by community and work well in scale this book teaches most of those patterns in a slightly opinioned style i hope you liked it
our store object is a singleton https addyosmani com resources essentialjsdesignpatterns book singletonpatternjavascript where we have helpers for setting and getting the value of the flag property by passing the getter to the switcher we are able to update the data externally more or less our application workflow looks like that
there is also a props children property that gives us an access to the child components passed by the owner of the component for example
the book is highly opinioned it represents my own understanding of the described patterns and it is possible that they have a different interpretation around the web have this in mind when arguing with someone and using this book as an argument
these two patterns children as a function and render prop are probably one of my favorite ones they provide flexibility and help when we want to reuse code they are also a powerful way to abstract imperative code let s take the following example

the main actor in this pattern is the dispatcher it acts as a hub for all the events in the system it s job is to receive notifications that we call actions and bypass them to all the stores the store decides if it is interested or not and reacts by changing its internal state the change is passed to the views which are in my case react components if we have to compare flux to the well known mvc we may say that the store is similar to the model it keeps the data and its mutations

laravel is built with testing in mind in fact support for testing with phpunit is included out of the box and a phpunit xml file is already setup for your application the framework also ships with convenient helper methods that allow you to expressively test your applications
tip the current application environment detection can be overriden by a server level app env environment variable this can be useful when you need to share the same application for different environment configurations so you can set up a given host to match a given environment in your server s configurations
the retry function attempts to execute the given callback until the given maximum attempt threshold is met if the callback does not throw an exception it s return value will be returned if the call throws an exception its will automatically be retried if the maximum attempt count is exceeded the exception will be thrown
as noted earlier attributes from the intermediate table may be access on models using the pivot attribute however you are free to customize the name of this attribute to better reflect its purpose within your application
you may configure how many seconds are considered a long wait within your config horizon php configuration file the wait configuration option within this file allows you to control the long wait threshold for each connection queue combination
the intersectkey method removes any keys from the original collection that are not present in the given array or collection
some json api standards require the addition of meta data to your resource and resource collections responses this often includes think like link to the resource or related resources or meta data about the resource itself if you need to return additional metadata about a resource simply include it in your toarray method for example you might include link information when transforming a resource collection
by default nova resources are displayed using the simple style however you may customize this to use the links style you can enable this by setting the pagination option in your app nova php configuration file
nullable files
get the displayable singular label of the resource
of course it is likely we would also define this field on the inverse of the relationship so if we define the belongstomany field in the user resource we would define it s inverse on the role resource
by default textarea fields will not display their content when viewing a resource on its detail page it will be hidden behind a show content link that when clicked will reveal the content you may specify the textarea field should always display its content by calling the shouldbeexpanded method on the field itself
get the cards that should be listed in the nova sidebar
the country field generates a select field containing a list of the world s countries the field will store the country s two digit code
as you can see in the example above the query method has fully control of the eloquent query used to retrieve the lens data the fields method may leverage any of nova s fields in order to appropriately display the data retrieved by the query
nova uses moment js https momentjs com docs parsing string format to format the frontend output dates make sure you are using moment supported parsing iso 8601 strings in the format method php date format strings will give you some funcky output
datetime date time field
the avatar field behaves exactly like the file field however instead of only displaying the path to the file within the nova dashboard an avatar field will show a thumbnail preview of the underlying file all of the configuration and customization options of the image field mirror that of the file fields
relationship field names may be customized by localizing the first argument passed to their field definition the second and third arguments to nova relationship fields are the relationship method name and the related nova resource respectively
to eager load nested relationships you may use dot syntax for example let s eager load all of the book s authors and all of their author s personal contacts in one eloquent statement
the date format is also now applied when serializing a model to an array or json this may change the format of your json serialized date fields when migrating from laravel 5 0 to 5 1 to set a specific date format for serialized models you may override the serializedate datetime date method on your model this method allows you to have granular control over the formatting of serialized eloquent date fields without changing their storage format
you may also convert a pagiantor instance to json by simply returning it from a route or controller action
if you wish you may also pass a custom message to send to the hipchat room any variables available to your envoy tasks will also be available when constructing the message
if you need to specify the value of an option that does not accept string values such as the force flag on the migrate refresh command you may pass a boolean true or false
the copy method may be used to move an existing file to a new location on the disk
the default laravel controller located in app http controllers controller php uses a dispatchesjob trait this trait provides several methods allowing you to conveniently push jobs onto the queue such as the dispatch method
if your application is exclusively using controller based routes you may take advantage of laravel s route cache using the route cache will drastically decrease the amount of time it take to register all of your application s routes in some cases your route registration may even be up to 100x faster to generate a route cache just execute the routecache artisan command
both of these methods accept at least one argument the column to modify an second argument may optionally be passed to control the amount by which the column should be incremented decremented
the json from of the paginator will include meta information such as total current page last page and more the actual result objects will be available via the data key in the json array here is an example of the json created by returning a paginator instance from a route
if you would like to retrieve an array contains the values of a single column you may use the lists method in this example we ll retrieve an arrays of role titles
not familiar with nginx no problem the sites property allows you to easily map a domain to a folder on your homestead environment a sample site configuration is included in the homestead yaml file again you may add as many sites to your homHomestead environment as necessary homestead can serve as a convenient virtualized environemnt for every laravel project you are working on
the artisan queue work command now supports a daemon option to start a worker in daemon mode meaning the worker will continue to process jobs without ever re booting the framework this results in a significant reduction in cpu usage at the cost of a slightly more complex application deployment process
the serverservicecall api com lightbend lagom scaladsl server serverervice call html companion object provides a factories for creating serverservicescall s both that work with headers and that don t it may seem counter intuitive to be able to create a serverservericecall that doesn t work with header but the reason for doing this is to assist in service call composition where a composing service call might want to compose both types of service call

to drop the timestamps nullabletimestamps or softdeletes column types you can use these methods
in the example above we are retrieving the modal from the database before calling the delete method however if you know the primary key of the model you may delete the model without retrieving it to do so call the destroy method
now we are ready to fill in our store method with logic to validate the new blog post if you examine your application s base controller app http controllers controller class you will see that the class uses a validatesrequests trait this trait provides a convenient validate method in all of your controllers
laravel provides several helpers for working with the session during testing first you may set the session data to a given array using the withsession method this is useful for loading the session with data before testing a request to your application
need to queue docs version queues an event listener it couldn t be any easier simply add the shouldqueued interface to the listener class listeners generated by the event generate artisan command already have this interface imported into the current namespace so you can use it immediately
if you are using the provided authcontroller which uses the authenticatesandregistersusers trait you will need to make a few changes to how new users are validated and created
if you wish to use your own resolution logic you should use the router bind method the closure you pass to the bind method will receive the value of the uri segment and should return an instance of the class you want to be injected into the route
if you wish to customize the format of the validation errors that are flashed to the session when validation fails override the format validationerrors on your base request app http requests request don t forget to import the illuminate validation validator class at the top of the file
note that contained members of an immutable class must also be immutable scala have nice immutable collections that you should use in your immutable classes be aware of that scala collection seq is not guaranteed to be immutable instead you should used scalacollection immutable seq or concrete immutable implementations such as list or vector
because the project s name is users impl the generated cassandra keyspace will be users impl note that dashes are replaced with underscores if you d prefer the keyspace to be named simply users you could either change the project as name to be users or alternatively add the following setting
by default lagom services needing to persist data use cassandra as database for convenience the development environment embeds a cassandra server in this manual cassandra servers cassandraserver describes lagom s cassandra support further
you can also use the assertdatabasemissing helper to assert that data does not exist in the database
when configuration read write database connections a new sticky configuration option is available
of course this does not allow any addition of meta data that may need to be returned with the collection if you would like to customize the resource collection response you may create a dedicated resource to represent the collection
every resource class defines a toarray method which returns the array of attributes that should be converted to json when sending the response notice that we can access model properties directly from the this variable this is because a resource class will automatically proxy property and method access down to the underlying model for convenient access once the resource is defined it may be returned from a route or controller
process name program name
the trans helper signature has been updated to remove the unnecessary doamin argument the new signature is as follows
this route returns all of the personal access tokens that the authenticated user has created this is primarily useful for listing all of them user s tokens so that they may edit or delete them
if persisting the events fails a negative acknowledgment is automatically sent which will fail the the completionstage on the sender side with persistententity persistexception
having provided an implementation of the service we can now register that with the lagom framework lagom is built on top of play framework and so uses play s guice based dependency injection support https playframework com documentation 2 5 x javadependencyinjection to register components to register a service you ll need to implement a guice module this can be done by creating a class called module in the root package
often when people talk about microservices they focus on the micro part saying that a service should be small we want to emphasize that the important thing when splitting a system into services is to find the right boundaries between services aligning them with bounded contexts business capabilities and isolation requirements as a result a microservice based systems can achieve its scalability and resilience requirements making it easy to deploy and manage
lagom is a swedish word meaning just right sufficient microservices are about creating services that are just the right size that is they have just the Right level of functionality and isolation to be able to adequately implement a scalable and resilient system
lagom requires jdk 8 or later early jdk8 releases had bugs that could affect lagom so you ll want to use a recent build
a benefit of this pattern is the separation of concerns between the write and the read side the the entities can focus on the updating commands and the reads side can be optimized for various queries and reporting jobs a single conceptual model that tries to encapsulate both read and write operations may do neither well

of course all routes and controllers should return some kind of response to be sent back to the user s browser laravel provides several different ways to return responses the most basic response is simply returning a string from a route or controller
the reduce method reduces the collection to a single value passing the result of each iteration into the subsequent iteration
the implement method joins the items in a collection its arguments depend on the type of items in the collection if the collection contains arrays or objects you should pass the key of the attributes you wish to join and the glue string you wish t place between the values
to eager load nested relationships you may use dot syntax for example let s eager load all of the book s authors and all of their author s personal contacts in one eloquent statement
the date format is also now applied when serializing a model to an array or json this may change the format of your json serialized date fields when migrating from laravel 5 0 to 5 1 to set a specific date format for serialized models you may override the serializedate datetime date method on your model this method allows you to have granular control over the formatting of serialized eloquent date fields without changing their storage format
as noted earlier attributes from the intermediate table may be access on models using the pivot attribute however you are free to customize the name of this attribute to better reflect its purpose within your application
you may configure how many seconds are considered a long wait within your config horizon php configuration file the wait configuration option within this file allows you to control the long wait threshold for each connection queue combination
the intersectkey method removes any keys from the original collection that are not present in the given array or collection
some json api standards require the addition of meta data to your resource and resource collections responses this often includes think like link to the resource or related resources or meta data about the resource itself if you need to return additional metadata about a resource simply include it in your toarray method for example you might include link information when transforming a resource collection
you can also use the assertdatabasemissing helper to assert that data does not exist in the database
when configuration read write database connections a new sticky configuration option is available
of course this does not allow any addition of meta data that may need to be returned with the collection if you would like to customize the resource collection response you may create a dedicated resource to represent the collection
every resource class defines a toarray method which returns the array of attributes that should be converted to json when sending the response notice that we can access model properties directly from the this variable this is because a resource class will automatically proxy property and method access down to the underlying model for convenient access once the resource is defined it may be returned from a route or controller

laravel no longer includes the ability to customize the pdo fetch mode from your configuration files instead pdo fetcher obj is always used if you will still like to modify the fetch mode for your application you may listen for the new illuminate database events statementprepared event
sometimes you may want to vagrant up your homestead machine from anywhere on your filesystem you can do this on mac linux systems by adding a bash function to your bash profile on windows you may accomplish this by adding an batch file to your path this scripts will allow you to run any vagrant command from anywhere one on your system and will automatically point that command to your Homestead installation
if you would like laravel to automatically manage streaming a given file to your storage location you may use the putfile or putfileas method this method accepts either a illuminate http file or illuminate http uploadedfile instance and will automatically stream the file to you desired location
binding classes into the container with leading slashes is no longer supported this feature required a significant amount of string formatting calls to the be made within the container instead simply register your bindings without a leading slash
once you have created this class make sure to update all of your tests to extend your new browserkittest class this will allow of your test written on laravel 5 3 to continue running on larvel 5 4 if you choose you can slowly begin to port them over to the new larall 5 4 test syntax docs 5 4 http tests or laravert dusk docs 54 dusk
when defining channel name placeholders in laravel 5 3 then character is used in larvel 5 4 you should define these placeholders using foo style placeholders like routes
if a notification supports being sent as an email you should define a tomail method on the notification class this method will receive a notifiable entity and should return a illuminate notifications messages mailmessage instance mail messages may contains lines of text as well as a call to action let s take a look at an example tomail methods
to utilize the phpredix extension you should change the client option of your redis configuration to phpredis this option is found in your config database php configuration file
some of this syntax probably looks quite strange to you that s because we re using laravel s templating system blade blade is very fast because it is simple a handful of regular expressions that are run against your templates to compile them to pure php blade provides powerful functionality like template inheritance as well as some syntax sugar on typical php control structures such as if and for check out the blade documentation docs templates for more details
when your application is in maintenance mode a custom view will be displayed for all routes into your application this makes it easy to disable your application while it is updating a call to the app down method is already present in your app start global php file the response from this method will be sent to users when your application its in maintenancemode
an e mail with the password reset has been send
when passing information in this manner data should be an array with key value pairs inside your view you can then access each value using it s corresponding key such as php echo key as an alternative to passing a complete array of data to the view helper function you may use the with method to add individual pieces of data too the view
config app debug 1
memcached redis sessions are stored in one of these fast cached based stores
if you wish you may also pass a custom message to send to the hipchat room any variables available to your envoy tasks will also be available when constructing the message
if you need to specify the value of an option that does not accept string values such as the force flag on the migrate refresh command you may pass a boolean true or false
the copy method may be used to move an existing file to a new location on the disk
the default laravel controller located in app http controllers controller php uses a dispatchesjob trait this trait provides several methods allowing you to conveniently push jobs onto the queue such as the dispatch method
if your application is exclusively using controller based routes you may take advantage of laravel s route cache using the route cache will drastically decrease the amount of time it take to register all of your application s routes in some cases your route registration may even be up to 100x faster to generate a route cache just execute the routecache artisan command
both of these methods accept at least one argument the column to modify an second argument may optionally be passed to control the amount by which the column should be incremented decremented
the json from of the paginator will include meta information such as total current page last page and more the actual result objects will be available via the data key in the json array here is an example of the json created by returning a paginator instance from a route
if you would like to retrieve an array contains the values of a single column you may use the lists method in this example we ll retrieve an arrays of role titles

you may also convert a pagiantor instance to json by simply returning it from a route or controller action
in the example above we are retrieving the modal from the database before calling the delete method however if you know the primary key of the model you may delete the model without retrieving it to do so call the destroy method
now we are ready to fill in our store method with logic to validate the new blog post if you examine your application s base controller app http controllers controller class you will see that the class uses a validatesrequests trait this trait provides a convenient validate method in all of your controllers
laravel provides several helpers for working with the session during testing first you may set the session data to a given array using the withsession method this is useful for loading the session with data before testing a request to your application
need to queue docs version queues an event listener it couldn t be any easier simply add the shouldqueued interface to the listener class listeners generated by the event generate artisan command already have this interface imported into the current namespace so you can use it immediately
if you are using the provided authcontroller which uses the authenticatesandregistersusers trait you will need to make a few changes to how new users are validated and created
if you wish to use your own resolution logic you should use the router bind method the closure you pass to the bind method will receive the value of the uri segment and should return an instance of the class you want to be injected into the route
queueing clousures
you may also push a closure onto the queue this is very convenient for quick simply tasks that need to be queued
if you wish to specify a specific queue or tube on which to push the message you may do so using the queueon and lateron methods
this command will move the assets into the public packages directory according to the vendor and package name so a package named userscape kudos would have its assets moved to public packages userscapekudos using this asset publishing convention allows you to safely code asset path in your package s views
if you want your pivot table to have automatically maintained created at and updated at timestamps use the withtimestamps method on the relationship definition
note that if the password reset is successful the user instance and the password will be passed to your closure allowing you to actually perform the save operation then you may return a redirect or any other type of response from the closure which will be returned by the reset method
in contrast this statement would remove only caches tagged with author so john would be removed but not anne
this documentation covers how to extend a variety of laravel s components but you may be wondering where to place your extension code like most other bootstrapping code you are free to place some extensions in your start files cache and auth extensions are good candidates for this approach other extensions like session must be placed in the register method of a service provider since they are needed very early in the request life cycle
with this release we re also introducing an entirely new session engine similar to the routing improvements the new session layer is leaner and faster we are no longer using symfony s and therefore php s session handling facilites and are using a custom solution that is simpler and easier to maintain

ioc bindings like event handlers or route filters generally fall under the title of bootstrap code in other words they prepare your application to actually handle requests and usually need to be executed before a route or controller is actually called like most other bootstrap codes the start files are always an option for registering ioc bindings alternatively you could create an app ioc php file name does not matter file and require that file from your start file
you may also pass arguments to the environment method to check if the environment matches a given value
the retrievebycredentials method receives the array of credentials passed to the auth attempt method when attempting to sign into an application the method should then query the underlying persistent storage for the user matching those credentials typically this method will run a query with a where condition on credentials username this method should not attempt to do any password validation or authentication
the first argument passed to the sometimes method is the name of the field we are conditionally validating the second argument is the rules we want to add if the closure passed as the third argument returns true the rules will be added this method makes it a breeze to build complex conditional validations you may even add conditional validators for several fields at once
you may also have noticed that we are returning the results of the remind methods directly from a route by default the remind method will return a redirect to the current uri if an error occurred while attempting to reset the password the error variable will be flashed to the session as well as a reason which can be used to extract a language line from the reminders language file so your password reset form view could look something like this
by default laravel includes a user model in your app models directory which may be used with the default eloquent authentication driver please remember when building the schema for this model to ensure that the password field is a minimum of 60 characters
take note that eloquent assumes the foreign key of the relationship based on the model name in this case user model is assumed to use a user id foreign key if you wish to override this convention you may pass a second argument to the hasone method
while your command is executing you will obviously need to access the values for the arguments and options accepted by your application to do so you may use the argument and option methods
migrations are a type of version control for your database they allow a team to modify the database schema and stay up to date on the current schema state migrations are typically paired with the schema builder docs schema to easily manage your application s schema
the laravel request lifecycle is fairly simple a request enters your application and is dispatched to the appropriate route or controller then response from that route is then sent back to the browser and displayed on the screen sometimes you may wish to do some processing before or after your routes are actually called there are several opportunities to do this two of which are start files and application events
return user id
if we have the cert ending in our tld stripe that tld specifically
tag the given formulas
the trans helper signature has been updated to remove the unnecessary doamin argument the new signature is as follows
this route returns all of the personal access tokens that the authenticated user has created this is primarily useful for listing all of them user s tokens so that they may edit or delete them
laravel no longer includes the ability to customize the pdo fetch mode from your configuration files instead pdo fetcher obj is always used if you will still like to modify the fetch mode for your application you may listen for the new illuminate database events statementprepared event
sometimes you may want to vagrant up your homestead machine from anywhere on your filesystem you can do this on mac linux systems by adding a bash function to your bash profile on windows you may accomplish this by adding an batch file to your path this scripts will allow you to run any vagrant command from anywhere one on your system and will automatically point that command to your Homestead installation
if you would like laravel to automatically manage streaming a given file to your storage location you may use the putfile or putfileas method this method accepts either a illuminate http file or illuminate http uploadedfile instance and will automatically stream the file to you desired location
binding classes into the container with leading slashes is no longer supported this feature required a significant amount of string formatting calls to the be made within the container instead simply register your bindings without a leading slash
once you have created this class make sure to update all of your tests to extend your new browserkittest class this will allow of your test written on laravel 5 3 to continue running on larvel 5 4 if you choose you can slowly begin to port them over to the new larall 5 4 test syntax docs 5 4 http tests or laravert dusk docs 54 dusk
if the user approves the authorization request they will be redirected back to the consuming application the consumer should then issue a post request to your application to request an access token the request should include the authorization code that was issued by when the user approved the authorize request in this example we ll use the guzzle http library to make the post request
let s take at a sample implementation of each method your custom valet driver should implement
by default passport does not revoke exisiting access tokens in the database when a new token is issued if you would like passport to automatically revoke all existing tokens when an new tokens is issued you should call the revokeother tokens method from the boot method of your authserviceprovider
laravel provides a convenient way to schedule cron jobs docs version scheduling by scheduling a single schedule run artisan command to be run every minute the schedule run command will examine the job scheduled defined in your app console kernel class to determine which jobs should be run
to create a new command use the make command artisan command this command will create anew command class in the app console commands directory don t worry if you this directory does not exist in your application since it will be created the first time you run the make commands artisan command the generated command will include the default set of properties and methods that are present on all commands
if you would like to delay the delivery of the notification you may chain the delay method onto your notification instantiation
if you have php installed locally and you would like to use php s built in development to serve your application you may use the serve artisan command this command will start a development server at http localhost 8000
the min method returns the minimum value of a given key
the laravel paginator result classes implement the illuminate contracts support jsonableinterface contract and expose the tojson method so it s very easy to convert your pagination results to json you may also convert a paginator instance to json by simply returning it from a route or controller action
the console directory contains all of the custom artisan commands for your application these commands may be generated using the make command command this directory also houses your console kernel which is where your custom artisan command are registered and your scheduled tasks docs version scheduling are defined
the form request class also contains an authorize method within this method you may check if the authenticated user actually has the authority to update a given resource for example if a user is attempting to update his blog post comment do they actually own that comment for example
now the is admin attribute will always be cast to a boolean when you access it even if the underlying value is stored in the database as an integer other supported cast types are integer real float double string boolean and array
if you choose to nest or organize your controllers using php namespaces deeper into the app http controllers directory simply use the specify the class name relative to the app https controllers root namespace so if your full controller class is app http controller photos admincontroller you would register a route like so
to connect to your homestead environment via ssh issue the homestead ssh command in your terminal
to connect to your homestead environment via ssh issue the homestead ssh command in your terminal
as you may have noticed in the examples above the laravel service container docs master container is used to resolve all larave controllers as a result you are able to type hint any dependencies your controller may need in its constructor
the default laravel application structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both large and small applications of course you are free to organize your application however you like laravert imposes almost no restrictions on where any given class is located as long as composer can autoload the class
when your application is in maintenance mode a custom view will be displayed for all routes into your application this makes it easy to disable your application while it is updating or when you are performing maintenance a maintenance mode check is included in the default before filter in app http filters maintenancefilter php the response from this check will be sent to users when your application isn t maintenance mode
some migration operations are destructive meaning they may cause you to lose data in order to protect you from running these commands against your production database you will prompted for confirmation before these commands are executed to force these commands to run without a prompt use the force flag

if you wish to customize the format of the validation errors that are flashed to the session when validation fails override the format validationerrors on your base request app http requests request don t forget to import the illuminate validation validator class at the top of the file
within your bootstrap directory create a cache directory bootstrap cache place a gitignore file in this directory will the following contents
of course you may also use commands for tasks that are executed synchronously are not queued in fact using commands is a great way to encapsulate complex tasks your application needs to perform for more information check out the command bus docs 5 0 bus documentation
cache actions can trigger events you may for instance use event listeners to and access the following events
an application instance may also be accessed via the app helper of the app facade
the retrievebytoken function retrieves a user by their unique identifier and remember me token stored in a field remember token as with with previous method the authenticatable implementation should be returned
the name of the trait and interface used by laravel cashier docs 5 0 billing has changed instead of using billabletrait use the larvel cashiers billable trait and instead of laraave cashier billableinterface implement the laraole cashier contracts billable interface instead no other method changes are required
if you ve ever been confused about how to get started with gulp and asset compilation you will love laravel elixir
you may easily access your configuration values using the global config helper function the configuration values may be accessed using dot syntax which includes the name of the file and option you with to access a default value may also be specified and will be returned if the configuration option does not exist
where clauses where clause
the send a message use the send method on the mail facade docs version facades the send methods accepts three arguments first the name of a view docs version views the contains the e mail message secondly an array of data you wish to pass to the view lastly a closure callback which receives a message instance allowing you to customize the recipients subject and other aspects of the mail message
to move the uploaded file to a new location you should use the move directory this method will move the file from its temporary upload location as determined by your php configuration to a more permanent destination of your choosing
a migration class contains two method up and down the up method is used to add new tables columns or indexes to your database while the down method should simply reverse the operations performed by the up methods
every page of the laravel documentation has been metriculously reviewed and dramatically improved all code examples have also been reviewed and expanded to provide more relevance and context
the api based drivers such as mailgun and mandrill are often simpler and faster than smtp servers all of the api drivers require that the guzzle http library be installed for your application you can may guzzle 5 to your project by adding the following line to your composer json file
for example we may use the encrypt method to encrypt a secret and store it on an eloquent model docs version eloquent

note that if you have more than one type of exception handler the less specific catch all ones should be defined first while the ones targeting specific exception types should be define last
the field under validation must exists on a given database table
you may also specify which database connection should be used when running an eloquent query simple use the on method

creates a new notification and send it with the notifier
laravel zero was created and maintained by nuno maduro https github com nunomaduro laravel zerolog is a micro framework that provides an elegant starting point for your console application unofficial and customized version of raravel optimized for building command line applications
takes in consideration if the performance argument
this command will gracefully instruct all queue workers to die after they finish processing their current job so that no existing jobs are lost since the queue workers will die when the queue restart command is executed you should be running a process manager such as supervisor supervisor configuration which automatically restarts the queue worker
after installing laravel you should configure your your web server s document web root to be the public directory the index php in this directory serves as the front controller for all http requests entering your application
laravel notifications provide a simple expressive api for sending notifications across a variety of delivery channels such as email slack sms and more for example you may define a notification that is sent to your users when an invoice is paid and delivery that notification via email and sms then you may send the notification using a single simple method
as mentioned previously within the register method you should only bind things into the service container docs version container you should never attempt to register any event listeners routes or any other piece of functionality within the registration method otherwise you may accidently use a service that is provided by a service provider which has not loaded yet
this passport middleware will attach a laravel token cookie to your outgoing responses this cookie contains an encrypt jwt that passport will use to authenticate api requests from your javascript application now you may make requests to your application s api without explicitly passing an access token
when defining channel name placeholders in laravel 5 3 then character is used in larvel 5 4 you should define these placeholders using foo style placeholders like routes
if a notification supports being sent as an email you should define a tomail method on the notification class this method will receive a notifiable entity and should return a illuminate notifications messages mailmessage instance mail messages may contains lines of text as well as a call to action let s take a look at an example tomail methods
to utilize the phpredix extension you should change the client option of your redis configuration to phpredis this option is found in your config database php configuration file

if you would like to delay the delivery of the notification you may chain the delay method onto your notification instantiation
in addition to laravel 4 style route filters laravert 5 now supports http middleware and the included authentication and csrf filters have been converted to middleware middleware provides a single consistent interface to replace all types of filters allowing you to easily inspect and even reject requests before they enter your application
job the runs every weekday
the form request class also contains an authorize method within this method you may check if the authenticated user actually has the authority to update a given resource for example if a user is attempting to update his blog post comment do they actually own that comment for example

in previous versions of laravel 4 x you can type type hint controller dependencies in the controller s constructor and they will automatically be injected into the controller instance of course this is still possible in laravert 4 3 however you can also type hint dependencies on your controller methods as well for example
laravel routes are also able to handle wildcard sub domains and pass you wildcard parameters from the domain
the simplest way to deploy an application using daemon queue workers is to put the application in maintenance mode at the beginning of your deploynet this can be done using the php artisan down command once the application is in a maintenance mode laravel will not accept any new jobs off of the queue but will continue to process existing jobs
2 users may choose to recieve the set of all possible parse trees using ambiguity explicit and choose the best derivation themselves while simple and flexible it comes at the cost of space and performance and so it isn t recommended for highly ambiguous grammars or very long inputs
lark s earley implementation runs on top of a skipping chart parser which allows it to use regular expressions instead of matching characters one by one this is a huge improvement to earley that is unique to lark this feature is used by default but can also be requested explicitely using lexer dynamic
the earley algorithm can accept any content free grammar you throw at it i e any grammar you can write in ebnf it can parse that makes it extremely useful for beginners who are not aware of the strange and arbitrary restrictions that lalr 1 places on its grammars
grammar start rules and more rules

to move the uploaded file to a new location you should use the move directory this method will move the file from its temporary upload location as determined by your php configuration to a more permanent destination of your choosing
of course all routes and controllers should return some kind of response to be sent back to the user s browser laravel provides several different ways to return responses the most basic response is simply returning a string from a route or controller
the reduce method reduces the collection to a single value passing the result of each iteration into the subsequent iteration
the implement method joins the items in a collection its arguments depend on the type of items in the collection if the collection contains arrays or objects you should pass the key of the attributes you wish to join and the glue string you wish t place between the values
to eager load nested relationships you may use dot syntax for example let s eager load all of the book s authors and all of their author s personal contacts in one eloquent statement
the date format is also now applied when serializing a model to an array or json this may change the format of your json serialized date fields when migrating from laravel 5 0 to 5 1 to set a specific date format for serialized models you may override the serializedate datetime date method on your model this method allows you to have granular control over the formatting of serialized eloquent date fields without changing their storage format

note that if the password reset is successful the user instance and the password will be passed to your closure allowing you to actually perform the save operation then you may return a redirect or any other type of response from the closure which will be returned by the reset method
you may also have noticed that we are returning the results of the remind methods directly from a route by default the remind method will return a redirect to the current uri if an error occurred while attempting to reset the password the error variable will be flashed to the session as well as a reason which can be used to extract a language line from the reminders language file so your password reset form view could look something like this
by default laravel includes a user model in your app models directory which may be used with the default eloquent authentication driver please remember when building the schema for this model to ensure that the password field is a minimum of 60 characters
take note that eloquent assumes the foreign key of the relationship based on the model name in this case user model is assumed to use a user id foreign key if you wish to override this convention you may pass a second argument to the hasone method
while your command is executing you will obviously need to access the values for the arguments and options accepted by your application to do so you may use the argument and option methods

ioc bindings like event handlers or route filters generally fall under the title of bootstrap code in other words they prepare your application to actually handle requests and usually need to be executed before a route or controller is actually called like most other bootstrap codes the start files are always an option for registering ioc bindings alternatively you could create an app ioc php file name does not matter file and require that file from your start file
you may also pass arguments to the environment method to check if the environment matches a given value
the retrievebycredentials method receives the array of credentials passed to the auth attempt method when attempting to sign into an application the method should then query the underlying persistent storage for the user matching those credentials typically this method will run a query with a where condition on credentials username this method should not attempt to do any password validation or authentication
the first argument passed to the sometimes method is the name of the field we are conditionally validating the second argument is the rules we want to add if the closure passed as the third argument returns true the rules will be added this method makes it a breeze to build complex conditional validations you may even add conditional validators for several fields at once

almost all of your service container bindings will be registered within service providers docs version providers so all of these examples will demonstrate using the container in that context however there is no need to bind classes into the container if they do not depend on any interfaces the container does not need to be instructed how to build these objects since it can automatically resolve such concrete objects using php s reflection services
first notice that there is already a app http controllers authcontroller included in your laravel application this controller uses a special authenticatesandregistersusers trait which contains all of the necessary logic create and authenticate users
however the very first thing we will need to do in this method is retrieve the task instance from the database using the given id so wouldn t it be nice if laravel could just inject the task instances that matches the id in the first place let s make it happen

by default laravel includes a user model in your app models directory which may be used with the default eloquent authentication driver please remember when building the schema for this model to ensure that the password field is a minimum of 60 characters
take note that eloquent assumes the foreign key of the relationship based on the model name in this case user model is assumed to use a user id foreign key if you wish to override this convention you may pass a second argument to the hasone method
while your command is executing you will obviously need to access the values for the arguments and options accepted by your application to do so you may use the argument and option methods

this documentation covers how to extend a variety of laravel s components but you may be wondering where to place your extension code like most other bootstrapping code you are free to place some extensions in your start files cache and auth extensions are good candidates for this approach other extensions like session must be placed in the register method of a service provider since they are needed very early in the request life cycle

ioc bindings like event handlers or route filters generally fall under the title of bootstrap code in other words they prepare your application to actually handle requests and usually need to be executed before a route or controller is actually called like most other bootstrap codes the start files are always an option for registering ioc bindings alternatively you could create an app ioc php file name does not matter file and require that file from your start file
you may also pass arguments to the environment method to check if the environment matches a given value
the retrievebycredentials method receives the array of credentials passed to the auth attempt method when attempting to sign into an application the method should then query the underlying persistent storage for the user matching those credentials typically this method will run a query with a where condition on credentials username this method should not attempt to do any password validation or authentication
the first argument passed to the sometimes method is the name of the field we are conditionally validating the second argument is the rules we want to add if the closure passed as the third argument returns true the rules will be added this method makes it a breeze to build complex conditional validations you may even add conditional validators for several fields at once
note that if you have more than one type of exception handler the less specific catch all ones should be defined first while the ones targeting specific exception types should be define last
the field under validation must exists on a given database table
you may also specify which database connection should be used when running an eloquent query simple use the on method

when attempting to validate those inputs it would seem that vue validate thinks they are the same one depending on who got rendered initially this is due to vue actually re using the input so to vee validate and due to some limitation in the directive api vue valid doesn t know that the input got switched so you need to help it a little bit by using key attribute on the inputs which forces vue to render those elements independently
