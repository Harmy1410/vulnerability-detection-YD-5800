in many to many relations the relation between the two components is always an aggregate relation and the association table is owned by both ends for example in the case of users and groups when user is being deleted the groups it belongs to are not being deleted and the associations between this user and the group it belongs too are being deleted
sometimes you may not want that association table rows are being deleted when user group is being deleted you can override this behaviour by setting the relations to association component in this case groupuser explicitly

a simple way to ensure the browser picks up changed files is by using output filename substitutions configuration output output filename the hash substitution can be used to include a build specific hash in the filename however it s even better to use the chunkhash substitution which includes a chunk specific hash on the filename
lazy or on demand loading is a great way to optimize your site or application this practice essentially involves splitting your code at logical breakpoints and then loading it once the user has done something that requires or will require a new block of code this speeds up the initial load of the application and makes the lightens its overall weight as some blocks may never even be loaded
sometimes you may not want that association table rows are being deleted when user group is being deleted you can override this behaviour by setting the relations to association component in this case groupuser explicitly
however you should not use it above is the same behaviour implemented much more efficiently
validate constraints validate none for example to enable all validations except length validations you would use
a transaction isolation level sets the default transactional behaviour as the name isolation level suggests the setting determines how isolated each transation is or what kind of locks are associated with queries inside a transaction the four availible levels are in ascending order of strictness
dql overcomes this problem with subqueries and with complex but efficient subquery analysis in the next example we are going to fetch first 20 users and all their phonenumbers with single efficient query notice how the dql parser is smart enough to use column aggregation inheritance even in the subquery and how its smart enough too use different aliases for the tables in the subclass to avoid alias collisions
following aggregate functions are availible on dql count max min avg sum

the transition group component has another trick up its sleeve it can not only animate entering and leaving but also changes in position the only new concept you need to know to use this feature is the addition of the v move class which is added when items are changing positions like the other classes its prefix will match the value of match a provided name attribute and you can also manually specify a class with the move class attribute

but there is a very important pre requisite your entry chunk must be defined with the define property if not webpack will create the amd module but without dependencies
for more info on how to use the api please go to extracttextplugin api https github com webpack extract text webpack plugin api
loaders are not cachedable by default loaders must opt out if they are not cacheable
however since this is a literal prop its value is passed down as the plain string 1 instead of an actual number if we want to pass down an actual javascript number we need to use the dynamic syntax to make its value be evaluated as a javascript expression
1 the app component do not know what content may be present inside its mount target it is decided by whatever parent component that is using app
with the dedicated shorthand syntax for v bind and v on the intents can be clearly and succinctly conveyed in the template
hot component reloading when a vue component is edited all of its active instances are hot swapped without reloading the page this means when making small changes e g tweaking the styles or the template your app doesn t need to fully reload the state of the app the the swapped component can be preserved drastically improving the development experience
the component system is another important concept in vue js because it s an abstraction that allows us to build large scale applications composed of small self contained and often reusable components if we think about it almost any type of application interface can be abstracted into a tree of components
in the example above the computed property relies on vm msg because this is an observed data property on the vue instance it is considered a reactive dependency whenever vm msg is changed vm example s value will be re evaluated
wrap the handler to debounce it for x milliseconds where x is the argument default is 300ms a debounced handler will be delayed until at least x ms has passed after the call moment if the handler is called again before the delay period the delay duration is reset to x ms

a computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values when you data bind to a computed property inside the template vue knows when to update the dom when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed this can be very powerful and makes your code more declarative data driven and thus easier to maintain
targetvm could be useful when v on is used with v repeat since the latter creates a lot of child viewmodels however it is often more convenient and explicit to use an invocation expression passing in the current alias which equals the current data object being interpolated on
a big difference from normals directives is that element directives are terminal which means once vue encounters an element directive it will leave that element and all its children alone only the element directive itself will be able to manipulate that elements and its children
if the string starts with it will be used as a queryselector and use the selected element s innerhtml and the template string this allows the use of the common script type x template trick to include templates
the minified standalone build of vue js has already stripped out all the warnings for you for a smaller file size but when you are using tools like browserify for webpack to build vuejs applications it s not so obvious how to do that

if no argument is provided the template will be created as an out of document element and you will have to use other dom instance methods to insert it into the document yourself if replace option is set to false then an empty div will be automatically created as the wrapper element calling mount on an already mounted instance will have no effect the method returns the instance itself so you can chain other instance methods after it
alternatively you can bind the directive directly to an object the keys of the object will the list of attributes to set based on corresponding values

vue js precise dependency tracking makes it the one of the most efficient view layer for small hot updates but there s always room for improvement in 0 12 internal instance creation and compilation refactors have improved first render performance for large lists by up to 40 with proper track by usage re rendering with large brand new dataset http vuejs github io js repaint perfs vue is also comparable to or even faster other virtual dom based frameworks
it is common practice to bundle all the javascript into one file when building large single page applications but when the file becomes too large we may want to defer loading parts of our application for a faster initial load however this does pose some constraints on how the application architecture should be designed it could be very tricky to figure out how to properly split up your javascript bundles
in 0 12 the filter argument syntax now follows a simple rules if an argument is enclosed in quotes it will be passed in as a plain string otherwise it will been evaluated against the current vm as a dynamic value
you should avoid directly setting elements of a data bound array with indices because those changes will not be picked up by vue js instead use the argument set method

we re going to fix this bug by introducing something we ve dubbed the app state pattern the basics are that you want to add an object to the di container that you will use to coordinate state between related components because the appstate object is managed by the dicontainer it can outlive the components and hold on to state even when the ui is changing a lot another benefit of the appState pattern is that it leads to greater separation between presentation components and logic
a case that isn t handled is when an event needs to cause an ancestor or unrelated component to also re render one of this cases is the confirmconfigurepizzadialog delegate which is triggered by a button on configurepizzeddialog so the sequence of actions by default is
next let s can make it possible for orderstate to produce its own state change notifications
if this structure looks weird to you cross check it with your layout file which follows a similar pattern even though renderfragment is a delegate type the way to render it not be invoking it it s by placing the value in a normal expression so the runtime may invoke it

a spring simply animates values from one state to another updates are accumulative strings remember all the values you ever pass you can use arbitrary names there are a couple of reserved keywords like from for base values you can learn about the api here api the received props are not static values these props are self updating you cannot use them in regular divs and such
values that apply to new elements or fitem values

span classname highlight keyframes is a factory that extends either spings or trails span you start by defining one or many named slots in which you place the properties you want to animate by default all unknown props are interpolate as to you can use i all i spring props otherwise from config reset etc it creates a component that bears a special state prop which receives the name of one of the slots it will execute it and run its animations

react spring builds upon animated s foundation casting its imperative side out making it leaner and more flexible it inherits react motions declarative api and goes to great lengths to simplify it it has lots of useful primitives can interpolate mostly everything and last but not least can animate by committing directly to the dom instead of re rendering a component frame by frame
react spring is a cooked down fork of christopher chedeau s animated https github com animatedjs animated which is used in react native by default it is trying to bridge it with cheng lou s react motion https githubcom chenglou react motion although both are similar in that they are spring physics based they have their pros and cons and could definitively benefit from one another

one the selling points of elixir is its support for concurrency thanks to the erlang vm beam concurrency in elixir its easier than expected the concurrency model relies on actors a contained process that communicates with other processes through message passing
negative values will be move backwards in time
percent escapes all characters that require escaped in a string

elixir also supports unicode in identifiers since elixir v1 5 as defined in the unicode annex 31 http unicode org reports tr31 the focus of this document is to describe how elixir implements the requirements outlined in the unicorn annex these requirements are referred to as r1 r6 and so on

set the pool mode to manual for explicitly checkouts
note changeset valid will not check constraints such as uniqueness constraint for that you will need to attempt to do an insert and check for errors from the database it s for this reason it s best practice to try inserting data and validation the returned tuple from friends repo insert to get the correct errors as prior to insert the changeset will only contain validation errors fromthe application itself
a changeset is required as it is the only for mechanism for

in this lesson we will learn about spec and type syntax first is more syntax complement for writing documentation that could be analyzed by tools second helps us to write more readable and easier to understand code

mix is a smart and will compile your changes when necessary but it may still be necessary explicitly compile your project in this section we ll cover how to compile our project and what compilation does
changesets take care of filtering validating maintaining constraints when changing a model
it is important to note that we setup the repo as a supervisor with supervisor 3 and not worker 3 if you generated your app with the sup flag much of this exists already
support for substraction is provided via the 2 operator it s safe to subtract a missing value
there are three additional operators who s first argument must be a boolean true and false
children defined using a list and the workers 3 function we imported from supervisor spec the worker 3 function takes a module arguments and a set of options under the hood worker 3 calls start link 3 with our arguments during initialization
what if don t want to link two processes but still be kept informed for that we can use process monitoring with spawn monitor when we monitor a process we get a message if the process crashes without our current process crashing or needing to explicitly trap exits
lists are simple collections of values they may include multiple types lists may include non unique values
iex enum min 5 3 0 1
add elixir script as a compiler
while it s possible to defined unused operators such as and to override predefined operators suchas the elixir community generally discourages this custom defined operators can be really hard to read and even more to understand as they don t have a descriptive name like functions do that said some specific cases or custom domain specific languages dsls may justify these practices

the purpose of this guide is to give every ember developer a starting point for making your ember application minimally accessible as accessibility can be a complex issue it should be noted that this guide only covers a some of the basics and should not be considered a comprehensive guide a good place to start is introduction to web accessibility https www w3 org wai fundamentals accessibility intro provided by the web accessibility initiative wai

applies a function pairwise to two lists you can use it
in the averagenamelength example we are requiring that our input is a list of strings if someone tries to pass in a listof integers or books the string length function would break so this contract rules that out we also say the averagamelength function is definitely going to return a float so if we use its result somewhere else we have a 100 guarantee that it s a floating point number
now lets make a function that tells us if a number is over 9000
tuples are another useful data structure a tuple can hold a fixed number of values and each value can have any type a common use is if you need to return multiple values from a function the following function vets a name and gives a message for the user

emotion can be used in many different ways if you are not using react the easiest way to get started is to use the emotion core package packages emotion core if you re not use react you will need the emotion package vanilla
however you can define a theme type by creating a another styled instance
babel plugin emotion also supports setting the name of emotion s exports via the importednames option this is useful for targetting a prop other than css for processing this will change to be a seperate option
the examples in this documentation use react but emotion is not limited to react the exceptions to this are react emotion and pre react emotion that export styled docs styled md they require react and preact respectively everything from the emotion package works with any library or framework
calling it directly will allow for some low level customization

as with djangodelpermissions you can use custom model permissions by overriding djangomodelPermissions and setting the perms map property refer to the source code for details
when you re using modelserializer all of this is handled automatically for you if you want to drop down to using a serializer classes instead then you need to define the validation rules explicitly
the function must take a pair of arguments this first is the exception to be handled and the second is a dictionary containing any extra context such as the view currently being handled the exception handler function should either return a response object or return none if the exception cannot be handled if the handler returns none then the exception will be re raised and django will return a standard http 500 server error response
we try to avoid this is possible for performance reasons
drf url filter drf url filters is a simple django app to apply filters on drf modelviewset s queryset in a clean simple and configurable way it also supports validations on incoming query params and their values a beautiful python package voluptouos is being used for validations in the incoming query parameters the best part about voluptuos is you can define your own validations as per your query params requirements
for example is has expired was a property on the account model then the following serializer would automatically generate it as a readonlyfield

rather that write multiple views we re grouping together all the common behavior into classes called viewsets
serialize save save will be called on each updated or newly created instance
first of all let s refactor our userlist and userdetail views into a single userviewset we can remove the two views and replace then with a single class
if you want to provide totally custom behavior you can override baserouter and override the get urls self method the method should inspect the registered viewsets and return a list of url patterns the registered prefix viewset and basename tuples may be inspected by accessing the self registry attribute
the drf any permissions drf many permissions packages provides a different permission behavior in contrast to the rest framework only one of the given permissions have to be true in order to get access to the view
also note that if you re using a post save signal to create tokens then the first time you create the database tables you ll need to ensure any migrations are run prior to creating any superusers for example
notice that we can also use various attributes that would typically be used on form fields such as widget widgets testarea these can be used to control how the serializer should render when displayed as an html form this is particularly useful for controlling how the browsable api should be displayed as we ll see later in the tutorial

what rest framework doesn t do is give you is machine readable hypermedia formats such as hal hal collection json collection json api json api or html microformats by default or the ability to auto magically create fully hateoas style apis that include hypermedia based form descriptions and semantically labelled hyperlinks doing so would involve making opinionated choices about api design that should really remain outside of the framework s scope
by default the response content will be rendered with the highest priority renderer apart from browseableappirenderer if you need to customize this behavior for example to use html as the default return format but use json in the browseable api you can do so by overriding the get default renderer method for example

the field flags can also control how the serializer should be displayed in certain circumstances such as when rendering to html the base template textarea html flag above is equivalent to using widget widgets textarea on a django form class this is particularly useful for controlling how the browsable api should been displayed as we ll see later in the tutorial
the to internal value method is called to restore a primitive datatype into its internal python representation this method should raise a serializer validationerror if the data is invalid

in its earliest days react benefitted tremendously from feedback ideas and technical contributions of early adopters and collaborators all over the company while it might look like an overnight success in hindsight the story of react is actually a great example of how new ideas often need to go through several rounds of refinement iteration and course correction over a long period of time before reaching their full potential

the size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging react now uses rollup https rollupjs org to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats resulting in both size and runtime performance wins the flat bundle format also means that react s impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how your ship your app whether it s with webpack browserify the pre built umd bundles or any other system

there is nothing bad about using state or lifecycle hooks in components like any powerful features they should be used in moderation but we have no intention to remove them on the contrary we think they are integral parts of what makes react useful we might enable more functional patterns https github com reactjs react future tree master 07 20 20returning 20state in the future but both local state and lifecycle hook will be a part of that model
if the calculator owns the shared state it becomes the source of truth for the current temperature in both inputs it can instruct them both to have values that are consistent with each other since the props of both temperatureinput components are coming from the same parent calculator component the two inputs will always be in sync

since index js is just javascript you can optionally read these settings for a file or generate them dynamically
while you could maintain multiple sets of divergent theme files to create different themes for your app s interface the preferred and easiest way to accomplish dynamic theming is to largely share the same set of theme files across your entire app an easy way to do just this is to create a set of mapping theme files that map your root constants from named values describing their appearance to named values described their function for example
to enable dynamic theming where you would normally use the theme class application methods on mtftheme for a single theme you should instead use the identically named methods on myfdynamicthemeapplier when you wish to have more than one theme this enables you to easily re apply a new theme to your entire interface just by changing the theme property on your mtftchemeapporter
while you could write multiple entirely different sets of theme files to create themes for your app s interface the preferred and easiest way to accomplish dynamic theming is to largely share the same set of themes files across your entire app an easy way to do just this is to create a set of mapping theme files that map your root constants from named values describing their appearance to named values described their function for example
we now have everything we need able to style our buttons to match the spec to do so we must instantiate a mtftheme object from our theme file to access our theme from our code the best way to do this is to use them fromjsonthemenamed which works just like imagenamed but for mtftcheme instead of uiimage
next we ll create the property appliers necessary to apply this theme to our interface elements most of the time motif is able to figure out how to apply your theme automatically by matching motif property names to objective c property names however in the case of some properties we have to declare how we d it to be applied ourselves to do this we ll register our necessary theme property applier in the initialize method of a few categories
here we ve added two property appliers to uiview for both borderwidth and borderercolor since these properties are defined on calayer rather than uivify we need to create property appliciers to enable these same properties from the button class to be applied

moreover one of the reasons why generative models are powerful lie in the fact that they have many fewer parameters than the amount of data that they are trained with as a result the models have to efficiently distill the essence of the training data to be able to generate new samples we see that our particular probabilistic model of bedrooms has done a good job of capturing the data s essence and can therefore produce highly realistic images some examples of which are shown below
maincolumn assets img junctionpath png a chain mrf whose cliques are organized into a chain structure round nodes represent cliques and the variables in their scope rectangular nodes indicates segments which are variables forming the intersection of the scopes of two neighboring cliques
the end result of this chapter will be a new technique called the junction tree jt algorithm this algorithm will first execute two runs of the ve algorithm to initialize a particular data structure holding a set of pre computed factors once the structure is initialized it will be used to answer marginal queries in o 1 time
using variable elimination one can show that running the ve elimination algorithm implicitly generates a junction tree over the variables thus it is possible to use the heuristics we previously discuss to define this ordering

optimal trees are one that make the clusters are small and modular as possible unfortunately it is again np hard to find the optimal tree we will see below some practical ways in which we can find good junction trees
the variable elimination algorithm will repeatedly perform two factor operations product and marginalization we have been implicitly been performing these operations in our chain example
before we start our discussion of learning let s first reflect on what it means it fit a model and what is a desirable objective for this task
in the directed case we found that i g subseteq i p but there were distributions p whose independencies could not be described by p in the undirected case the same holds for example consider a probability described by a directed v structure i e the explaining away phenomenon the undefined model cannot describe the independence assumption x perp y
when normalized we can view phi a b as an interaction that pushes them b s vote closer to that of a the term phi b c pushes b s votes closer to c and the most likely vote will require reconciling these conflicting influences

again it is easy to understand intuitively why this is true two graphs are in equivalent is the d separation between variables is the same we can flip the directionality of any edge unless it forms a v structure and the d connectivity of the graph will be unchanged we refer the reader to the textbook of koller and friedman for a full proof

keywords are syntax elements of javascript such as function and if these identifiers have special meaning to the language and so often appear in a different color in code editors as an important part of the language style guides often refer to the spacing that should be used around keywords for example you might have a style guide that says keywords should be always be preceeded by keywords which would mean if else statements must look like this
when it comes to naming variables styleguides generally fall into one of two camps camelcased variablename and underscores variable name this rule focuses on using the camelcase approach if your stylamuide calls for camelcasing your variable names then this rule is for you
the max statements rule allows you to specify the maximum number statements allow in a function

on top of this react provides a component lifecycle function shouldcomponentupdate which is triggered before the re rendering process starts virtual dom comparison and possible eventual dom reconciliation giving the developer the ability to short circuit this process the default implementation of this function returns true leaving react to perform the update
in rare situations an element may want to change the props of a element that it doesn t own like changing the classname of an element passed as this props children other times it may want t make multiple copies of any element passed to it clonewithprops makes this possible
in the example above since shouldcomponentupdate returned false for the subtree rooted at c2 react had no need to generate the new virtual dom and therefore it neither needed to reconcile the dom note that react didn t even had to invoke shouldcomponent update on c4 and c5
we accept any tag to be rendered but since this gets injected into arbitrary

different ordering may dramatically alter the running time of the variable elimination algorithm
next the marginalization operation locally eliminates a set of variables from a factor if we have a factor phi x y over two sets of variables x y marginalizing y produces a new factor
so now the algorithm proceeds in the same way as above as long as their is a factor or variable ready to transmit to a variable or factor respectively send the appropriate factor to variable or variable to factor message as defined above
the sum product message passing variant of belief propagation can also be applied to factor trees with a slight modification recall that a factor graphs is a bipartite graph with edges going between variables and factors with an edge signifying a factor depends on a variable we can perform ve on factor graphs through a modified version of the above algorithm

sampling in general is not an easy problem our computers can only generate samples from very simple distributions sidenote 1 even those samples are not truly random they are actually taken from a deterministic sequence whose statistical properties e g running averages are indistinguishable form a truly random one we call such sequences pseudorandom such as the uniform distribution over 0 1
a better way of computing such integrals is via an approach called importance sampling the main idea is to sample from a distribution q hopefully roughly proportional to f cdot p and then reweigh the samples in a principled way so that their sum still approximates the desired integral
we can also use probabilitic graphical models for audio applications suppose we construct a probability distribution p x for audio signals that assigns high probability to ones that sound like human speech
suppose we have a model p y x 1 x n of word occurrences in spam and non spam mail each binary variable x i encodes whether the i th english word is present in the email the binary variable y indicates whether the email is spam in order to classify a new email we may look at the probability m p y 1 x 1 n em
p x mid z mathcal n z vec mu z vec sigma z odot i
to get a first taste of the of the challenges that lie ahead of us consider a simple application of probabilistic modeling spam classification
given a probabilistic model such as a bayes net on an mrf we are interested in using it to answer useful questions e g determining the probability that a given email is spam more formally we will be focusing on two types of questions
first consider what happens if we run the ve algorithm on a tree in order to compute a marginal p x i we can easily find an optimal ordering for this problem by rooting the tree at x i and iterating through the nodes in post order sidenote 1 a postorder traversal of a rooted tree is one that starts from the leaves and goes up the tree such that a node is always visited after all of its children the root is visited last
the em algorithm can be seen as iteratively optimizing the elbo over q at the e step and over theta at the m step

etcd can now run as a transparent proxy running etcd as a proxy allows for easily discovery of etcd within your infrastructure since it can run on each machine as a local service in this mode etcd acts as a reverse proxy and forwards client requests to an active etcd cluster the etcd proxy does not participate in the consensus replication of the etcdd cluster thus it neither increases the resilience nor decreases the write performance of the ectd cluster

webpack bundling happens by default when you specify a module to the faast or faastaws function the module and its dependencies are collected by webpack and bundled into a single js file this placed into a zipfile and sent to aws lambda as the code package if you install dependencies using package json and import or require them in the usual way then webpack should be able to bundle your dependencies with no extra effort on your part
using the local provider allows you to test faast js on your local machine each invocation starts a new process up to the concurrency limit api faastjs commonoptions concurrency md processes are reused for subsequent calls just as they are in a real cloud function allows you two test caching strategies

the arguments for waitfor are an array of dispatcher registry indexes which we refer to here as each store s dispatchtoken when waitfor is encountered in a callback it tells the dispatcher to invoke the callbacks for the required stores after these callbacks complete the original callback can continue to execute thus the store that is invoking waitfor can depend on the state of another store to inform how it should update its own state

one of the biggest challenges of microservices is comprehending whats really happening at runtime certainly logging logging html and metrics metrics html really help in addition tracing can really help comprehend how microservices interact and diagnose performance issues
in fabric8 we use jenkins pipelines https jenkkins io to implement the pipeline for each microservice the pipeline is defined in a file called jenksfile which is checked into the source repository of each micro service so that it is versioned along with the implementation code
however if your microservice exposes a web application or api which is intended to be used by users or microservices hosted outside of the kubernetes cluster then you need to expose your micro service to an external host endpoint

the continuous deployment pipeline then starts when you release some binaries in fabric8 we expect released binaries to be stored in some kind of maven repository that doesn t necessary mean you need a maven repositories manager like nexus http www sonatype org nexus or artifactory it could just be a block storage nfs or http based website that rynch d or backed up

note currently helm does not properly support openshift since openshift uses lots of non standard resource kinds so for now we recommend not using helm for openshift instead we recommend using the gofabric8 installer gofabrica8 html for opensshift we do hope long term to have great helm support for openhift though as we view it as essential technology for managing upgrades of software
so its going to take a little while for us to get a fabric8 distribution thats easy to install and run on any kubernetes or openshift cluster that mimicks the functionality of openshift io https openshiftio but we will get there in the end

the size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging react now uses rollup https rollupjs org to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats resulting in both size and runtime performance wins the flat bundle format also means that react s impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how your ship your app whether it s with webpack browserify the pre built umd bundles or any other system

in rare situations an element may want to change the props of a element that it doesn t own like changing the classname of an element passed as this props children other times it may want t make multiple copies of any element passed to it clonewithprops makes this possible
in the example above since shouldcomponentupdate returned false for the subtree rooted at c2 react had no need to generate the new virtual dom and therefore it neither needed to reconcile the dom note that react didn t even had to invoke shouldcomponent update on c4 and c5

react native doesn t provide any guarantees about the types of values in these structures your native module might expect array of strings but if javascript calls your method with an array that contains number and string you ll get nsarray with nsnumber and nsstring it s developer s responsibility to check array map values types see reactconvert https github com facebook react native blob master react base rctconvert h for helper methods
you ll notice we used datasource from this state the next step is to add an empty datasource to the object returned by getinitialstate also now that we re storing the data in datasource we should not longer use this state movies to avoid storing data twice we can use boolean property of the state this state loaded to tell whether data fetching has finished
any additional user defined properties will be become properties of the rendered component for example here s how you would you render a ul with css class

in this chapter we added socket io transport and saw how to use channels to send events from server to client in the next chapter clients md we will look how to uses browser feathers application and client services to handle this events easily
this what feathers transports do a transport is a plugin that turns a feathers application into a server that exposes our services through different protocols for other clients to use since a transport involves running a server it won t work in the browser but we will learn later that there are complementary plugins for connecting to a feathers server in a browser feathers application
one of the goals of feathers is make building rest apis https en wikipedia org wiki representational state transfer easier since it is by far the most common protocol for web apis for example we want to make a request like get messages 1 and get a json response like id 1 text the first message you may already have noticed that the feathers service methods and the http methods like get post patch and delete are fairly complementary to each other
in this chapter we learned how feathers hooks can be used middleware for service method calls to validate and manipulate incoming and outgoing data without having to change our service in the next chapter we will turn our messages service into a fully functional rest api rest md
any service automatically emits created updated patched and removed events when the respective service method returns successfully this works on the client as well as on the server when the client is using socket io socketio md or primus primus md events will be pushed automatically from the server to all connected clients this is essentially how feathers does real time
