simply add another 105 grams of flour rye salt fullgrain to the bowl in front of you and add another 5 grams of water you might now be thinking why 105 grams and not 100 grams that s the reason why large scale bakeries use baking powder instead of yeast sourdough the mother dough eats around 5 of the dough and converts it into gas so just to be safe always add a little more back to the dough than you take it s really easy always add flour water in 1 1 ratio
you should have a nice bowl in which you can prepare your bread this can be made out of glass metal or plastic the bigger the better as it will be easier for you to work the dough in a larger bowl it s advisable to have two of the bowels the first bowl you will need to prepare and mix the dough before putting the dough into the oven you shape the dough and let it rest a clean bowl then with some parchment paper is ideal if you have a baneton you don t need the second bowl

the library supports generating code using an implicitly aligned leading dimension for the destination matrix of a multiplication the latter is enabling unaligned store instructions and also hints the inlined code accordingly the client code may be arranged at compile time preprocessor by checking the build parameters of the library aligned store instructions imply a leading dimension which is a multiple of the default alignment
the library provides a sophisticated dispatch mechanism see more details more details which is also targeting other instruction sets beside of the intrinsic code paths the library can be also compiled to mic native code which is able to run self hosted as well as in an offloaded code region via a fortran directive or via c c preprocessor pragma the prerequisite for offloading the code is to compile it to position independent pic code even when building a static library

a although it has many of the features of a framework we consider http4k to be a library which adds a common http routing layer is it incredibly unopinionated and has been designed to not enforce design decisions on the api user we use http4x for applications both large and small using no di framework
this example is the simplest possible server implementation note that we are not spinning up a server backend here but the entire application is testable but firing http requests at it as if it were
http4k https github com http4k http 4k is an lightweight but fully featured http toolkit written in pure kotlin https kotlinglang org that enables the serving and consuming of http services in a functional and consistent way http4x https githubcom http4y http4f applications are just kotlins functions which can be mounted into a running backend for example here s a simple echo server
composite lensfeatures now capture at least the first failing cause
the routing api is virtually identical to the standard http4k http protocol routing api
here s a entire http4k https github com http4x http4d application which echoes request body back to the user it only relies on the http4c core module which itself has zero dependencies
you can now finally go ahead and test the mutation run yarn start you ll be greeted with a very simple screen two input fields and a submit button not very pretty but functional
authentication and authorization are often confused authentication describes the process of claiming an identity that s what you do when you log in to a service with a username and password you authenticate yourself authorization on the other hand describes permission rules that specify which user the access rights of individual users and user groups to certain parts of the system
title chooser your favorite technology
is much nicer clients can event calculate the costs of their queries themselves without needing to estimate server time
simply be very large queries used by legitimate clients in both of these case the client
django already comes with the concept of users built in before talking about authentication let s create our first user
basically when a user sings up or logs in a token will be returned a piece of data that identify the user this token must be sent by the user in the http authorization header with every request when authentication is needed if you want to know more about how the token is generated take a look at the jtw site above
warning storing jwts in localstorage is not a safe approach to implement authentication on the frontend because this tutorial is focused on graphql we want to keep things simple and therefore are using it here you can read more about this topic here https www developers com 2018 please stop using local storage
the implementation of both resolvers is relatively straighforward nothing too surprising the only thing that s not clear right now is the hardcoded selection set containing only the id field what happens if the incoming mutation requests more information about the user

graphql schemas are usually written in the graphql schema definition languages https blog graph cool graphql sdl schema definition language 6755bcb9ce51 sdl the sdl has a type system that allows to define data structures just like other strongly typed programming languages such as java typescript swift go
typically these data types represent the entities of your application domain for example if you re building car dealership software you re like going to have data types such as car cardealer customer and so on the entire collection of these data type is referred to as your data model

the query mutation and subscription types are the entry points for the requests sent by the client to enable the allpersons query that we save before the query type would have to be written as follows
notice that you re already destructuring the server response and retrieving the createvote field from it
next import the creatlink component by adding the following statement to the top of app js
in createlink js add the following statement to the bottom of the file also replacing the current export default createlink statement
this effectively means that you ll never write any actual graphql queries yourself this is unlike the approach that s taken in apollo where you re also able to colocate data dependencies and react components but are most commonly doing so by writing actual queries instead of fragments

datamodel prisma defines your data model in the graphql schema definition language https blog graph cool graphql sdl schema definition languages 6755bcb9ce51 sdl when using prisma the datamodels is used to describe the database schema
firstly push it to the lower level by using proper defferedresolver function which rebuild it
open src components linklist vue and add the following object to the subscribetomore array
the demo server that you used as a deployment target for prisma is hosed for free in prisma cloud and comes with a connected database aws aurora
you can resolver the links relation in a similar way
there s one more thing you need to do before you can launch the graphql server again and test the new functionality ensuring the relation between user and link getters properly resolved
after every change you re making to the datamodel file you need to redeploy the prisma api to apply your changes and migrate the underlying database schema
now you can open a graphql playground by navigation to http localhost 4000 http local host 4000 where the graphql server is running
you also need to add variables in voteforlink method in linkitem component

unfortunately the graphiql web interface that we used before does not accept adding custom http headers from now on we will be using the insomnia desktop app you can download and install it here https insomnia rest download

endpoint the http endpoint for your prisma api it is actually required to deploy your prism api it will be generated when we deploy
create a new folder under hackersnews called users and a new file called schema py
basically when a user sings up or logs in a token will be returned a piece of data that identify the user this token must be sent by the user in the http authorization header with every request when authentication is needed if you want to know more about how the token is generated take a look at the jtw site above

this is the last section of the tutorial where you ll implemented the finishing touches on your api the goal is to allow clients to constrain the list of link elements returned by the feed query by providing filtering and pagination parameters
the last task in this chapter is to add a subscription that fires when new vote s are being created you ll use an analoguous approach as for the newlink query for that
the getuserid function is a helper function that you ll call in resolvers that require authentication such as post it first retrieves the authorization header which contains the user s jwt from the incoming http request if then verifies the jwt and retrievesthe user s id from it notice that if that process is not successful for any reason the function will throw an exception you can therefore use it to protect the resolver which require authentication
when the type of a root field is an object type you can further expand the query or mutation subscription with fields of that object type the expanded part is called selection set
in this chapter you ll get to know a new api that s called paginationcontainer and that provides a nice abstraction for implementing pagination in a rely app
context this is an object that get s passed through the resolver chain and every resolvers can read from or write to

if for any reason you don t use the virtual dom mechanism and decide to set the samp innerhtml samp in an element you run the risk of cross site scripting xss https en wikipedia org wiki cross Site scripting vulnerabilities specifically you must sanitize any user provided data before writing it out to the dom we suggest creating your own replacement function to explicitly state the intent of performing an unsafe operation

simply set plugin overscroll false when initializing scrollbars
customizing scrollbars is always a controversial issue on the one hand they provide full control of scrollbars but on the other hand they degrade user experience because native behavior is unmatchable as the author of this script i don t really want you to use it unless you are sure about what you are doing

for example rule sets can be divided across multiple ha pairs of rule nodes store nodes likely are subject to functional sharding regardless by assigning dedicated buckets per region datecenter
typical object storage prices per gb are at about 0 02 the number of retrieverals typically priced at 0 004 per 10 0000 by the store nodes strongly depend on individual querying pattern adding 20 to the total storage cost to account for retrievals and running of store nodes seems like a conservative estimate
master should be stable and usable every commit to master builds docker image named master data sha
the store gateway occupies small amounts of disk space for caching basic information about data in the object storage this will rarely exceed more than a few gigabytes and is used to improve restart times it is not useful but not required to preserve it across restarts
it is possible to expose thanos query ui and optionally api on a sub path
thanos supports any object stores that can be implemented against thanos objstore bucket interface pkg objstore objstore go

inferno proves that it is possible to be fast on mobile parse time load time rendering complex uis and all the normal things you d expect just work how inferno does that is based on many factors but ultimately inferno s code is much better understood by modern javascript engines and can be highly optimised to perform far better than other libraries frameworks
since then things haven t really improve much in the mobile space libraries have gotten smaller but the time to parse a 2mb app can result in 5 seconds time before the user can even see anything frameworks and libraries need to lose bloat they need to care about performance developing on a macbook pro and seeing animations routing complex uis instantly appear is not going to happen on an average mobile device especially in emerging countries

this section controls where the actual shard data for influxdb lives and how it is flushed from the wal dir may need to be changed to a suitable place for your system but the wal settings are an advanced configuration the defaults should work for most systems
when running influxdb in a production environment the wal directory the data directory should be on separate storage devices this optimization significantly reduces disk contention when the system is under heavy write load this is an important consideration if the write load is highly variable if the writes load does not vary by more than 15 the optimization is probably unneeded

the third level are stacks of probabilistic models which can model even more complex phenomena if a single hidden markov model can capture a dialect of a language such as a certain persons speech usage then a mixture of hidden markOV models may fine tune this to be situation specific for example a person may use more formal language at work and more casual language when speaking with friends by modeling this as a mixture off hmms we represent the persons language as an mixture of these dialects
a biparte graph where conditional probability tables are on one side
markov chains are not very complicated to chain for each sequence the appropriate symbols are sent to the appropriate distributions and maximum likelihood estimates are used to update the parameters of the distributions there are no latent factors to train and so no expectation maximization or iterative algorithms are needed to train anything

this project used to called flow it was renamed to akka serial
since hardware is involved in serial communication a scala only solution is not possible nevertheless the native code is kept simple and minimalistic with the burden of dealing with threads left to scala the code aims to be posix compliant and therefore easily portable
note an important feature of fat jars is to include binaries for several platforms to copy binaries compiled on other platforms to the fat jar place them in a subfolder of flow native lib native the subfolder should have the name os name os arch where os name and os arch are the java system properties of the respective platforms
the native binaries produced in the previous step may be bundled in a fat jar so that they can be included in sbt projects through its regular dependency mechanisms in this process sbt basically acts as a wrapper script around autotools calling the native build process and packaging generated binaries running sbt flow native scala packagebin in the base directory produces the fat jar in flow natives scala target
detailed procedure
examples on flow s usage are located in the flow samples directory the examples may be run by switching to the corresponding project in sbt project flow sample sample name and typing run be sure to connect a serial device before running an example
as flow integrates into the akka io framework a good resource on its general spirit is the framework s documentation at http doc akkaio docs akka 2 2 0 rc2 scala io html
