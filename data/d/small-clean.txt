At first , there are now a lot of things that most people use at home . For example : a fridge , a cooker , or just an electricity .
Anna prepared the cake . Peter organized the music . Heather and I went to buy the present ; Pat said : " OK , I 'll phone to some of Ted 's friends to invite them . "

Thank you a lot for your kind letter .
