sttwitter provides a full one to one objective c front end to twitter rest api it often results in long method names with many parameters in your application you may want to add your own simplified methods on top of sttwitterapi a good idea is to create an objective c category for your application such as in the following code

let s make a simple function that uses indexing from example a really naive implementation of a sum
as can be seen in both cases python and numba jit the results are the same this is because numba typeof is being evaluated with using the python run time n
when no type signature is provided the decorator returns wrapper code that will automatically create and run a numba compiled version when called when called resulting function will infer the types of the arguments being used that information will be used to generated the signature to be used when compiling the resulting compiled function will be called with the provided arguments n

because projects can easily move between developer computers source control repositories build servers and so forth it s highly impractical to keep binary assemblies from nuget packages directly bound to a project doing so would this make each copy of the project unnecessarily bloated and thereby waste space in source control repository it would also make it very difficult to update package binaries to newer versions as updates would have to be applied across all copies of the projects

we re going to write an integration with pact tests between a consumer the zoo app and its provider the animal service in the consumer project we re going going to need to need a model the alligator class to represent the data returned from the animals service and a client the animalserviceclient which will be responsible for making the http calls to the animal services
pact provides an fluent api for service consumers to define the http requests they will make to a service provider and the http responses they expect back these expectations are used in the consumer specs to provide a mock service provider the interactions are recorded and played back in the service provider specs to ensure the serv provider actually does provide the response the consumer expects
act is most valuable for designing and testing integrations where you or your team organisation partner organisation control the development of both the consumer and the provider it is a fantastic tool for testing intra operation microservices
the following code will create a mock service on localhost 1234 which will respond to your application s queries over http as if it were the real my service provider app it also creates a mockservice provider object which you will use to set up your expectations the method name to access the mock service provider will be what ever name you give as the service argument in this case my service providers

in this post we will implement a very basic test framework that runs integration tests inside instances of the qemu virtual machine it is not as realistic as running them on real hardware but it is much simpler and should be sufficient as long as we only use standard hardware that is well supported in qemus
we iterate over all screen characters and move each characters one row up note that the range notation is exclusive the upper bound we also omit the 0th row the first range starts at 1 because it s the row that is shifted off screen
unit testing is a very useful technique to ensure that certain components have a desired behavior even if they cannot show the absence of bugs they re still an useful tool for finding them and especially for avoiding regressions
information why this needs to be set explicitely and can t be derived from
some unique identifier possibly including an e mail address as is
under apis auth go to credentials and create a new client id probably you will want a web application client id provide your domain name or test domain name in authorized javascript origins finally fill in http 127 0 0 1 8000 accounts google login callback in the authorized redirect uri field you can fill multiple urls one for each test domain after creating the client id you will find all details for the django configuration on this page

almost all x86 systems have support for bios booting even newer uefi based machines they include an emulated bios this is great because you can use the same boot logic across all machines from the last centuries but this wide compatibility is at the same time the biggest disadvantage of bios Booting because it means that the cpu is put into a 16 bit compatibility mode called real mode before booting so that arcane bootloaders from the 1980s would still work

even though bits 48 to 64 are discarded they can t be set to arbitrary values instead all bits in this range have to be copies of bit 47 in order to keep addresses unique and allow future extensions like the 5 level page table this is called sign extension because it s very similar to the sign extension in two s complement when an address is not correctly sign extended the cpu throws an exception
the x86 64 architecture uses a 4 level page table and a page size of 4kib each page table independent of the level has a fixed sized of 512 entries each entry has a size of 8 bytes so each table is 512 8 6kib large and thus fits exactly into one page

macros are defined through one or more rules which are similar to match arms the println macro has two rules the first rule for is invocations without arguments e g println which is expanded to print n and thus just prints a newline the second rule is for invocations with parameters such as println hello or println number 4 it is also expanded to an invocation of the print macro passing all arguments and an additional newline n at the end
it is similar to our main rs but uses a custom idt called test idt and different start and breakpoint handler functions the most interesting part is the breakpointhandler caller static it is an atomicusize an integer type that can be safely concurrently modified because all of its operations are atomic we increment it when the break point handler is called and verify in our start function that the handler was called exactly once

the notify end of interrupt figures out whether the primary or secondary pic sent the interrupt and then uses the command and data ports to send an eoi signal to respective controllers if the secondary pic sends the interrupt both pics need to be notified because the secondary p is connected to an input line of the primary pic
the 8259 has 8 interrupt lines and several lines for communicating with the cpu the typical systems back then where equipped with two instances of the 8259 pic one primary and one secondary pic connected to one of the interrupt lines of the primary

def license from files

this guide is a living compendium documenting the most important patterns and recipes on how to use react and it s ecosystem in a functional style with typescript and to make your code completely type safe while focusing on a conciseness of type annotations so it s a minimal effort to write and to maintain types in the long run
if you try to use connect or bindactioncreators explicitly and want to type your component callback props as void this will raise compiler errors it happens because bindactionCreators typings will not map the return type of action creators to void due to a current typescript limitations
this solution uses type inference to get props type from mapstatetoprops function
now i want to to show you action helpers and explain their use cases we re going to implement a side effect responsible for showing a success toast when user adds a new todo
filter istypeof add toggle here action type is narrowed to a smaller union
warning when using string constants for action type please be sure to use simple string literals don t use string concatenation template strings or object map because your type will lose the type information widening to it s supertype string this is how typescript works
pro tip i can recommend to create a rootaction in the central point of your redux store it will model a complete representation of all possible action types in your application you can even merge it with existing third party declarations like it s shown below

this project requires rust nightly otherwise project build will fail we choose rust instead of go with which we ve developped tidb to develop this project because there are two critical facts firstly despite go s excellent gc it still introduces too much of latency time and instability secondly cgo s costs introduces another instable performance performance is our primary consideration then development efficiency so rust comes to our sight
