with this release we re also introducing an entirely new session engine similar to the routing improvements the new session layer is leaner and faster we are no longer using symfony s and therefore php s session handling facilites and are using a custom solution that is simpler and easier to maintain
note the form must have been opened with the file option set to true
you may also supply a locale argument to specify the language for example if you want to use the russian ru language

this documentation covers how to extend a variety of laravel s components but you may be wondering where to place your extension code like most other bootstrapping code you are free to place some extensions in your start files cache and auth extensions are good candidates for this approach other extensions like session must be placed in the register method of a service provider since they are needed very early in the request life cycle

the update events will be automatically triggered in riot tags containing dom handlers like onclick when a user will dispatch any of them setting the autoupdate option to false you will disable this behavior and you will need to manually trigger your tags updates
the shouldupdate method will always receive 2 arguments the first one contains the values you want to update via the tag update method and the second argument will be the new options received via tag attributes and normally stored in the opts object

sometimes you may need to retrieve the mixins object so alternatively you may set your global mixin object by name in the case the third boolean parameter indicates this mixin is not a shared but a global mixins
if two tags know about each other they become dependent and a tight coupling is introduced these tags cannot be freely moved around without breaking the system

the elements whose attribute is verified is specified using source
ioc bindings like event handlers or route filters generally fall under the title of bootstrap code in other words they prepare your application to actually handle requests and usually need to be executed before a route or controller is actually called like most other bootstrap codes the start files are always an option for registering ioc bindings alternatively you could create an app ioc php file name does not matter file and require that file from your start file
you may also pass arguments to the environment method to check if the environment matches a given value
the retrievebycredentials method receives the array of credentials passed to the auth attempt method when attempting to sign into an application the method should then query the underlying persistent storage for the user matching those credentials typically this method will run a query with a where condition on credentials username this method should not attempt to do any password validation or authentication
the first argument passed to the sometimes method is the name of the field we are conditionally validating the second argument is the rules we want to add if the closure passed as the third argument returns true the rules will be added this method makes it a breeze to build complex conditional validations you may even add conditional validators for several fields at once
note that if you have more than one type of exception handler the less specific catch all ones should be defined first while the ones targeting specific exception types should be define last
the field under validation must exists on a given database table
you may also specify which database connection should be used when running an eloquent query simple use the on method
native session will be handled by internal php runtimes
cache actions can trigger events you may for instance use event listeners to and access the following events
an application instance may also be accessed via the app helper of the app facade
the retrievebytoken function retrieves a user by their unique identifier and remember me token stored in a field remember token as with with previous method the authenticatable implementation should be returned

open source contributions from students have already reach an all time high with over one hundred and thirty students signed up for our real time contribution tracking leaderboard
all students and mentors are now busy mutually bonding and with our core team and greater community each mentor is also working with his her student on refining the weekly and monthly milestones deliverables within the proposal to better reflect achievable project objectives as well as making them measurable for the monthly evaluations meanwhile all our students are continuing to contribute to the rocket chat open source project as they have been since the start of the gsoc cycle
the simplest way to deploy an application using daemon queue workers is to put the application in maintenance mode at the beginning of your deploynet this can be done using the php artisan down command once the application is in a maintenance mode laravel will not accept any new jobs off of the queue but will continue to process existing jobs
not familiar with nginx no problem the sites property allows you to easily map a domain to a folder on your homestead environment a sample site configuration is included in the homestead yaml file again you may add as many sites to your homHomestead environment as necessary homestead can serve as a convenient virtualized environemnt for every laravel project you are working on
the artisan queue work command now supports a daemon option to start a worker in daemon mode meaning the worker will continue to process jobs without ever re booting the framework this results in a significant reduction in cpu usage at the cost of a slightly more complex application deployment process

you may also have noticed that we are returning the results of the remind methods directly from a route by default the remind method will return a redirect to the current uri if an error occurred while attempting to reset the password the error variable will be flashed to the session as well as a reason which can be used to extract a language line from the reminders language file so your password reset form view could look something like this
by default laravel includes a user model in your app models directory which may be used with the default eloquent authentication driver please remember when building the schema for this model to ensure that the password field is a minimum of 60 characters
take note that eloquent assumes the foreign key of the relationship based on the model name in this case user model is assumed to use a user id foreign key if you wish to override this convention you may pass a second argument to the hasone method
while your command is executing you will obviously need to access the values for the arguments and options accepted by your application to do so you may use the argument and option methods
migrations are a type of version control for your database they allow a team to modify the database schema and stay up to date on the current schema state migrations are typically paired with the schema builder docs schema to easily manage your application s schema
the laravel request lifecycle is fairly simple a request enters your application and is dispatched to the appropriate route or controller then response from that route is then sent back to the browser and displayed on the screen sometimes you may wish to do some processing before or after your routes are actually called there are several opportunities to do this two of which are start files and application events

we ve already discussed strings but now we can dive in a bit deeper and understand what strings in c really are which are called c strings to differentiate them from other strings when mixed with c
in our code we shifted by 2 added 2 to the initial address so that makes them 2 x 4byte 8
methods in c are portions of a larger program that perform specific tasks they can be used to keep code clean by seperating it into seperate peices they can also be used in more than one place allowing you to reuse previous code

our store object is a singleton https addyosmani com resources essentialjsdesignpatterns book singletonpatternjavascript where we have helpers for setting and getting the value of the flag property by passing the getter to the switcher we are able to update the data externally more or less our application workflow looks like that
there is also a props children property that gives us an access to the child components passed by the owner of the component for example
the book is highly opinioned it represents my own understanding of the described patterns and it is possible that they have a different interpretation around the web have this in mind when arguing with someone and using this book as an argument
these two patterns children as a function and render prop are probably one of my favorite ones they provide flexibility and help when we want to reuse code they are also a powerful way to abstract imperative code let s take the following example
presentational components are concerned with how the things look they have the additional markup needed for making the page pretty such components are not bound to anything and have no dependencies very often implemented as a stateless functional components https facebook github io react blog 2015 10 07 react v0 14 html stateless functionality components they don t have internal state
the main actor in this pattern is the dispatcher it acts as a hub for all the events in the system it s job is to receive notifications that we call actions and bypass them to all the stores the store decides if it is interested or not and reacts by changing its internal state the change is passed to the views which are in my case react components if we have to compare flux to the well known mvc we may say that the store is similar to the model it keeps the data and its mutations

third party developers have created plugins for platforms which allow select2 to be integrated more natively and quickly for many platforms additional plugins are not required because select2 acts as a standard select box
from the src directory will prevent merge conflicts from occuring making
this bug happens when using select2 without other plugins
if you are using select2 in a build environment where preexisting module names are changed during a build step select2 may not be able to find optional dependencies or language files you can manually set the prefixes to use for these files using the code amdbase code and code amdlanguagebase code options
i have attempted to find the simplest possible steps to reproduce the issue
select2 has an internal event system that works independently of the dom event system this internal events system is only accessible from plugins and adapters that are connected to select2

you can see how one of the core flutter plugins the single image picker https pub dartlang org packages images picker approaches and solves this problem in order to return file paths it just copies the selected image content to the tmp folder and retuns the file path from there now that works ok when you pick a single image
that s not easy task when we speak for cross platform compability for example on android the contentresolver return content uri s which not always have a file path on ios it gets s even more complicated since there is icloud and not all of your photos are stored physically on the phone there is no way to return the file path imediately without first downloading the original image from ircloud to the phone
that s it when you invoke the image picker you can then have to set enablecamera to true as it is disabled by default
