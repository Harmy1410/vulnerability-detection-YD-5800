now that we ve constructed our schema we need to hook up our data sources to our graphql api graphql apis are extremely flexible because you can layer them on top of any service including any business logic rest apis databases or grpc services

react apollo unlike many other tools in the react ecosystem requires no complex build setup to get up and running as long as you have a graphql server you can get started building out your application with react immediately react apollo works out of the box with both create react app and react native with a single install and with no extra hassle configuring babel or other javascript tools

should be externally configurable via arquillian xml selected metadata could be overrided in arqillian xml
i class icon star i annotation driven activation is now obsolote arquillianspecification revealed itself to be more problematic than valueable see jira issues below for details therefore we made a breaking change and got rid of it in favour for a custom test runner integrating both spock and the arquillian lifecycles from now on you should simply decorate your specification with decorators
p the learning curve for getting started with arquillian is minimized by the fact that it integrates with what you already know using junit for your unit tests then you can reuse your knowledge of junit to do integration testing testing arquill let s you choose and you can even run your arqillian tests right alongside unit tests in your ide
h3 highlight in this release
this allow you to write a java interface which automatically translates java api invocations to javascript calls
p the current api takes a declarative approach to configure the transactional behavior of the test case by annotating the testclass or the testmethod with transactional you control how the transaction should be handled after testmethod execution
debugging a test in a remote container that seems hard surprise it s not at all you only have to modify one of the step above and add one additional step
this minor release of the intergalatic cooperation between spock http code google com p spock and arquillian comes with following updates

ioc bindings like event handlers or route filters generally fall under the title of bootstrap code in other words they prepare your application to actually handle requests and usually need to be executed before a route or controller is actually called like most other bootstrap codes the start files are always an option for registering ioc bindings alternatively you could create an app ioc php file name does not matter file and require that file from your start file
you may also pass arguments to the environment method to check if the environment matches a given value

when the benefit of switching threads out weights the cost of the context switch in general you should make a method asynchronous if the synchronous method waits on the asp net request thread while doing no work by making the call asynchronous the aws net request threads is not stalled doing any work while it waits for the web service request to complete

the first argument passed to the sometimes method is the name of the field we are conditionally validating the second argument is the rules we want to add if the closure passed as the third argument returns true the rules will be added this method makes it a breeze to build complex conditional validations you may even add conditional validators for several fields at once
note that if you have more than one type of exception handler the less specific catch all ones should be defined first while the ones targeting specific exception types should be define last
the field under validation must exists on a given database table

data filtering plays a vital role in the security of modern web applications most security vulnerabilities are the result of improperly filtering data or neglecting to properly validate it because the previous section dealt with csrf attacks and the next two will be introducing xss attacks and sql injection there was no natural segue into dealing with as important a topic as data sanitization so in this section we paid special attention to it
different forms contain different pseudo random values as we ve introduced in section 4 4 how to prevent multiple form submission we can reuse the relevant code from that section suit our needs
this command will move the assets into the public packages directory according to the vendor and package name so a package named userscape kudos would have its assets moved to public packages userscapekudos using this asset publishing convention allows you to safely code asset path in your package s views
if you want your pivot table to have automatically maintained created at and updated at timestamps use the withtimestamps method on the relationship definition
note that if the password reset is successful the user instance and the password will be passed to your closure allowing you to actually perform the save operation then you may return a redirect or any other type of response from the closure which will be returned by the reset method
you may also have noticed that we are returning the results of the remind methods directly from a route by default the remind method will return a redirect to the current uri if an error occurred while attempting to reset the password the error variable will be flashed to the session as well as a reason which can be used to extract a language line from the reminders language file so your password reset form view could look something like this
by default laravel includes a user model in your app models directory which may be used with the default eloquent authentication driver please remember when building the schema for this model to ensure that the password field is a minimum of 60 characters
take note that eloquent assumes the foreign key of the relationship based on the model name in this case user model is assumed to use a user id foreign key if you wish to override this convention you may pass a second argument to the hasone method
while your command is executing you will obviously need to access the values for the arguments and options accepted by your application to do so you may use the argument and option methods
migrations are a type of version control for your database they allow a team to modify the database schema and stay up to date on the current schema state migrations are typically paired with the schema builder docs schema to easily manage your application s schema
the laravel request lifecycle is fairly simple a request enters your application and is dispatched to the appropriate route or controller then response from that route is then sent back to the browser and displayed on the screen sometimes you may wish to do some processing before or after your routes are actually called there are several opportunities to do this two of which are start files and application events

the default behavior when registering scope s in your api settings is that all of those scope s become immediately available and can be requested by any user to properly handle access control you will need to create policies which stipulate the conditions under which users can be granted certain scope s this can be done with rules see the documentation rules for how to use rules to create scope policies
to access secured resources from your api the authenticated user s access token needs to be included in requests that are sent to it this is typically accomplished either by sending the access token in an authorization header using the bearer scheme or by storing the token in a cookie so that it is included in all requests to your server these examples will focus on the former implementation but both approaches are valid

second for customers who have already been using api management another challenge is how to extract existing configurations into resource manager templates for those customers we have created another tool called extractor src api armtemplate readme md extractor to help them generate templates by extracting configurations from their existing api management instances
the key in this proposed approach is to keep all api management configurations in azure resource manager templates https docs microsoft com azure azure resources manager resource group authoring templates these templates should be kept in a source control system we will use git throughout this example as illustrated in the picture there is a publisher repository that contains all configurations of the production api management instance in a collection of templates

when attempting to validate those inputs it would seem that vue validate thinks they are the same one depending on who got rendered initially this is due to vue actually re using the input so to vee validate and due to some limitation in the directive api vue valid doesn t know that the input got switched so you need to help it a little bit by using key attribute on the inputs which forces vue to render those elements independently

the string number and boolean data types do not accept null as value when creating or updating records since null is neither a string number nor boolean the most specific data type that accurately describes it is json so for example if you want to describe a normal attribute whose values are sometimes numbers and sometimes null you ll want to use type json
furthermore for any attribute if you pass new date as a constraint within a waterline criteria s where clause or as a new record or within the values to set in a update query then these same rules are applied based on the type of the attribute if the attribute is type json it uses the latter approach

everything that can be build using the existing api eg helper functions is unlikely to be included in the api in the same spirit everything that can been build using only cocoa apis is unlikely t be included on the api a good example are the node js polyfills there are implemented in separate repositories and as such don t bloat the core api another good example is the sketch module web view which provides a ui which doesn t require any sketch integration
