searching the entire directory structure for files to copy based on file extensions is not optimal with large directory structures if we know what non template static content we want to appear in our output we can opt in to specify files or directories for eleventy to copy this will probably speed up your build times these entries are relative to your the root of your project and not your eleventys input directory
compare the post url and special eleventy provided page url variable to find the current page building on the previous example

here are a a few ways you can brainstorm how ai can help
if your application needs to work without an internet connection you can embed software libraries to call locally for example you can grab the stanford corenlp toolkit http stanfnlp github io corenlP to add language processing capabilities to your software such as part of speech tagging which tries to identify where are the nouns verbs adjectives adverbs and so are in your text

the default behavior can be can be overridden by individual providers
you can also attach the resolver to objecttype fields the same way as with authorized decorator authorization md
the only difference is that we have to let typegraphql know that this objecttype is implementing the interfacetype by passing the param implements iperson to the decorator if we implemented more interfaces we would pass the array of interfaces like implements ipERSON ianimal imachine
and that s why typegraphql has built in support for validation of arguments and inputs using class validator https github com typestack class validators features you can use awesomeness of decorators to declare the requirement for incoming data e g number is in range 0 255 or password is longer than 8 chars in an easy way
the main idea of typegraphql is to automatically create graphql schema definition from typescript s classes to avoid the need of schema definition files and interfaces describing the schema we use a bit of reflection magic and decorators
we can use the destruction syntax to have access to single arguments as variables instead of the reference to the whole args object

graphql s mutations we can create analogously by declaring the class method using mutation decorator providing return type if needed creating arguments etc but for mutation we usually use input types hence why typegraphql allows you to create inputs in the same way as the object types types and fields md but using inputtype decorator
first what we have to do is to decorate the class with e g objecttype decorator it marks the class as the object known from graphql sdl as type or graphqlobjecttypefrom graphql js

data ownership and lock in this is an important item make sure you understand who owns the data and whether the company providing a service is using your data in a way your are comfortable with are they using it to train models that they would then offer to your competitors what happens if they decide to stop offering their service what happens with your models how do you get your data sets and trained models off the service
if we inspire you to try adding some ai to your own software and we hope we do here are a few things to criteria to consider in selecting paid services

in order to secure requests so that third parties cannot easily use the resize service the application can require that requests provide a signature to enable this feature set the client key option the signature is a hexadecimal digest of the concatenation of the query string and the client keys using the md5 algorithm the below python code provides an example implementation
to verify that your client application is generating correct signatures use the signature command note as in the example below when verifying signatures the web application will not include the leading question mark from the query string when determining the signature

note that the current a curvedimage primitive implementation is a bit difficult to work with ensuring that the image is not distorted by stretching requires the developer to carefully set the radius theta length and height in relation to the source image aspect ration our intent is to dramatically simplify curved images in future versions of a frame so that developers can simply provide an image a length and a radius and get back an undistorted image perfectly fit to the cylinder surface
to ensure the image is not distorted make sure the width and height ratio matches the source bitmap width height ration for example if using an image that is sized 2000x1000 pixels we would create our image like so

primitives are concise semantic building blocks blocks that wrap a frame s underlying entity components core system a frame ships with a handful built in primitives for common use cases such as a cube a model and a sky these primitives are to help people get started with using a frame to uncover the full composability and extensibility of a frame dive down into the underlying entity component system core index html
distances in a frame are defined in meters when designing a scene for virtual reality it is very important to consider the real world scale of the objects we create a cube with height 100 may look fairly ordinary on our laptop screen but in virtual reality we will perceive it as a massive 100 meter tall monolith

practical issues numeric stability when you re writing code for computing the softmax function in practice the intermediate terms e f y i and sum j e f j may be very large due to the exponentials dividing large numbers can be numerically unstable so it is important to use a normalization trick notice that if we multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by a constant c and push it into the sum we get the following mathematically equivalent expression
the first strategy you may think of is to to try to extend one foot in a random direction and then take a step only if it leads downhill concretely we will start out with a random w generate random perturbations delta w to it and if the loss at the peturbed w delta w is lower we will perform an update the code for this procedure is as follows
in addition to the motivation we provided above there are many desirable properties to including the regularization penalty many of which we will come back to in later sections for example it turns out that including the l2 penalty leads to the appealing max margin property in svms see cs229 http cs229 stanford edu notes cs229 notes3 pdf lecture notes for full details if you are interested
we discussed the tradeoffs between computing the numerical and analytic gradient the numerical gradient is simple but it is approximate and expensive to compute the analytic gradient is exact fast to compute but more error prone since it requires the derivation of the gradient with math hence in practice we always use the analytic grad and then perform a gradient check in which its implementation is compared to to the numerical grad

finally version control is invaluable for collaborative projects where different people do work on the same code simultaneously it allows the changes made by different people to be tracked and can automatically combine peoples work via merging saving a great deal of painstaking effort to do so manually moreover version control hosting websites such as github provide way to communicate in a more structured way such as in code reviews about commits and about issues
though you much commit any work you have in progress before you will be able to switch you can see all branches of your project simply using
fundamentally the best way to deal with merge conflicts is to so far as is possible ensure they don t happen in the first place you can improve your own on this by keeping branches clean and focused on a single issue and involving as few files as possible before merging make sure you know what s in both branches and if you are not the only one that has worked on the branches then keep the lines of communication open so you are all aware of what the others are doing

a full web application can be built and run with openwhisk combining serverless apis with static file hosting for site resources e g html javascript and css means we can build entire serverless web applications the simplicity of operating a hosted openWhisk environment or rather not having to operate anything at all since it is hosted on bluemix is a great benefit compared to standing up and operating a node js express or other traditional server runtime
openwhisk is an apache incubator project https incubator apache org projects openwhisk html it is an open source implementation of a distributed event driven compute service you can run it on your own hardware on prem or in the cloud when running in thecloud you could use a plat from as as service paas version of the openWhisk provided by ibm bluemix or you can provision it yourself into infrastructure as a service apas clouds such as bluemify amazon ec2 microsoft azure google gcp etc

samza supports for both stateless and stateful stream processing stateless processing as the name implies does not retain any state associated with the current message after it has been processed a good example of this is filtering an incoming stream of user records by a field eg userid and writing the filtered messages to their own stream
samza supports at least once processing as the name implies this ensures that each message in the input stream is processed by the system at least twice this guarantees no data loss even when there are failures making samza a practical choice for building fault tolerant applications
apache samza is developed by an open and friendly community everybody is welcome to contribute and engage with the community we are happy to accept contributions be it trivial cleanups or bug fix or new features there are many ways to engage with them community and contribute to apache samza including filing bugs asking questions and joining discussions in our mailing lists contributing code or documentation or testing

the graphql specification includes the following default scalar types int float string boolean and id while this covers most of the use cases some need to support custom atomic data types e g date or add validation an existing type to enable this graphql allows custom scalar type enumerations are similar to custom scalars with the limitation that their values can only be one of a pre defined list of strings
subscriptions are another root level type similar to query and mutation to start we need add to add the subscription type to our schema
mocking logic simply looks at the type definitions and returns a string where a string is expected a number for a number etc this provides the right shape of result for more sophisticated testing mocks can be customized them to a particular data model

the default apollo server provides a health check endpoint at well known apollo servers health that returns a 200 status code by default if onhealthcheck is defined the promise returned from the callback determines the status code a successful resolution causes a 200 and rejection causes a 503 health checks are often used by load balancers to determine if a server is available

one of the main advantages of adopting graphql is its declarative approach to data fetching with graphql there s no need to call multiple endpoints from the client or aggregate the data manually like you have to with traditional rest data fetching instead you specify exactly the data you need and graphql gives you exactly what you asked for

to set up schema validation you will need to be both actively sending traces and registering schemas to apollo
there are many types of schema changes that can be potentially jarring to clients like removing a field if made without special consideration for safety some organizations take the approach of never making these types of changes but this leads to an ever growing schema and reduced api flexibility over time in reality making these type of changes to a schema can be very safe as long as you have tools in place to ensure that no queries are broken in the process
