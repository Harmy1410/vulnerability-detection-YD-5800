to specify a final state finitemachine uses the terminal method the terminal can accept more than one state
in order to integrate finitemachine with activerecord simply add a method with state machine definition you can also define the state machine is separate module to aid reusability once the statemachine is defined use the target helper to reference the current class having defined target you call activerecord methods inside the callbacks to persist the state

the octree library provides efficient methods for creating a hierarchical tree data structure from point cloud data this enables spatial partitioning downsampling and search operations on the point data set each octree node then has either eight children or no children the root node describes a cubic bounding box which encapsulates all points at every tree level this space becomes subdivided by a factor of 2 which results in an increased voxel resolution

if you have a an abstract class you can refactor to an object model composed from interfaces without loss of information you can also refactor back to an abstractclass these two refactorings are each others inverses so together they form an isomorphism
to be clear i m not trying to convince you that it d be great of you wrote all of your c or java using tuples of closures it most likely wouldn t be the point is that a class is isomorphic to a tuple of functions
in programming you often have the choice to implement a particular feature in more than one way these alternatives may be equivalent in which case they re isomorphic that s one of the reasons that many code bases come with a style guide
one of the first concepts you learned when you learned to program was that units of operation functions methods procedures take input and produce output input is in the form of input parameters and output is inthe form of return values sometimes though a method returns nothing but we know from category theory that nothing is also a value called em unit em
code aggregate code and many of the specialised methods throw an exception if the input sequence is empty this is because there s no identity element in a semigroup the method doesn t know how to create a value of the type code t code from an empty list
while the above definition is great for identifying a good abstraction it doesn t tell you have to create one
running this as a property based test it holds for all code x code generated by fscheck the same caution that applies to associativity also applies here code iexpression code is an extensibility point so you can t be sure that code plus identity code will be the the identity element for all codes ieexpression code implementations someone could create but for the the three implementations that now exist the monoid laws hold

an expression marker used text positions not attribute positions
it utilizes the built in js and html parsers it doesn t include any expression or markup parser of it s own
unlike vdom libraries list html only every updates the parts of templates that actually change it doesn 39 to ever re render the entire view
the first time html is called on a particular template literal it does one time setup work to create the template it joins all the string parts with a special placeholder then creates a template and sets its innerhtml to the result then it walks the template s dom and extracts the placeholder and remembers their location
since all expressions in a template literal are evaluated when the literal is evaluated you may want to only evaluate some expensive expressions when certain other values probably it s dependencies change guard would memoize function and only call it if the guard expression changed

the names passed as parameters in these methods like book author author name and book title are explicit column names these names are composed of the php name of the model and the phpname of the column separated by a dot e g author name manipulating object model names allows you to be detached from the actual data storage and alter the database names without necessarily updating the php code it also makes the use of table aliases much easier more on that matter later
rebuild your model and insert the table creation sql you will notice that the book table has two tables and not just one the behavior added an id column of type integer and autoincremented this column can be used as any other column
for many to many relationships meaning from the other side of a many to one relationship the process is a little different in the previous example one book has one author but one author has many books from the author point of view a one to many relationship relates it to book so propel doesn t generate an author setbook but rather an author addbook

laying out views should be easy which is why we brought the flexbox layout model from the web to react native flexbox makes it simple to build the most common ui layouts such as stacked and nested boxes with margin and padding react native also supports common web styles such as fontweight and the stylesheet abstraction provides an optimized mechanism to declare all your styles and layout right along with the components that use them and apply them inline
during the life of a project the model seldom stays the same new tables arise and existing tables often need modifications a new column a new index and the foreign key updating the database structure accordingly while preserving existing data is a common concern propel provides a set of tools to allow the migration of database structure and data with ease
the names passed as parameters in these methods like book author author name and book title are explicit column names these names are composed of the php name of the model and the phpname of the column separated by a dot e g author name manipulating object model names allows you to be detached from the actual data storage and alter the database names without necessarily updating the php code it also makes the use of table aliases much easier more on that matter later
rebuild your model and insert the table creation sql you will notice that the book table has two tables and not just one the behavior added an id column of type integer and autoincremented this column can be used as any other column
for many to many relationships meaning from the other side of a many to one relationship the process is a little different in the previous example one book has one author but one author has many books from the author point of view a one to many relationship relates it to book so propel doesn t generate an author setbook but rather an author addbook
generated model classes now offer a fromarray and a toarray method by default this feature existed before but was disabled by default in the build properties the addgenericaccessors and addgeneric accessors settings are therefore enabled by default on propel 1 5
when you call toarray on an object you can now ask for the related objects

hooks can be synchronous or asynchronous when they return a promise
if the rxdocument is not in sync synced fires false you can run resync to overwrite own changes with the new state from the database

this will store the document in the storage if it has been changed before call this everytime after calling the set method
to change data in your document use this function it takes the field path and the new value as parameter note that calling the set function will not change anything in your storage directly you have to call save afterly to submit changes

it won t scale especially well but given this is a prototype it ll be fine for now if our circumstances change and it s no longer appropriate it s simple to swap it out for something different because of the playerstore abstraction we have used
if we did started with the store code the amount of changes we d have to do would be very large compared to this this is a smaller step towards our final goal and was driven by tests
test our code if you can test a function easily it s usually because of dependencies hard wired into a function or global state if you have a global database connection pool for instance that is used by some kind of service layer it is likely going to be difficult to test and they will be slow to run di will motivate you to inject in a database dependency via an interface which you can then mock out with something you can control in your tests
it s has one function which expects two arguments the first being where we write our response and the second being the http request that was sent to us
we can write a test and implementing it by returning a hard coded value to get us started kent beck refers this as faking it once we have a working test we can then write more tests to help us remove that constant

the book is highly opinioned it represents my own understanding of the described patterns and it is possible that they have a different interpretation around the web have this in mind when arguing with someone and using this book as an argument
these two patterns children as a function and render prop are probably one of my favorite ones they provide flexibility and help when we want to reuse code they are also a powerful way to abstract imperative code let s take the following example
presentational components are concerned with how the things look they have the additional markup needed for making the page pretty such components are not bound to anything and have no dependencies very often implemented as a stateless functional components https facebook github io react blog 2015 10 07 react v0 14 html stateless functionality components they don t have internal state
the main actor in this pattern is the dispatcher it acts as a hub for all the events in the system it s job is to receive notifications that we call actions and bypass them to all the stores the store decides if it is interested or not and reacts by changing its internal state the change is passed to the views which are in my case react components if we have to compare flux to the well known mvc we may say that the store is similar to the model it keeps the data and its mutations

this pattern was almost never used in the wild and supporting it causes react to be slightly larger and slower than necessary so we are deprecating this pattern in 16 9 and logging a warning if it s encountered if you rely on it adding factorycomponent prototype react component prototype can serve as a workaround alternatively you can convert it to either a class or a function component

getsnapshotbeforeupdate is invoked right before the most recently rendered output is committed to e g the dom it enables your component to capture current values e g scroll position before they are potential changed any value returned by this lifecycle will be passed as a parameter to componentdidupdate
when a component is removed from within a react tree the cleanup is performed automatically but because we are removing the entire tree by hand we must call it this method
reorders can also cause issues with component state when indexes are used as keys component instances are updated and reused based on their key if the key is an index moving an item changes it as a result component state for things like controlled inputs can get mixed up and updated in unexpected ways
react previously shipped with an experimental context api the old api will be supported in all 16 x releases but applications using it should migrate to the new version the legacy api will been removed in a future major react version read the legacy context docs here docs legacy context html

duplicated data from props try to use props as the source of truth where possible one valid use to store props in state is to be able to know it s previous values because props can change over time
splice array of arrays for each item in array call splice on the target with the parameters provided by the item
this is a subtle difference but defaultprops are now resolved at reactelement creation time instead of when it s mounted this is means that we can avoid allocating an extra object for the resolve props
we wanted to make it easier for new users to see the parallel with the dom and why react is different to align our terminology we now use the term reactelement instead of descriptor likewise we use the terms reactnode instead of renderable
imagine if react createclass was just a plain javascript class if you call a class as a plain function you would call the component s constructor to create an component instance not a reactelement

interactions can be used to identify the cause of an update along the api for tracing them is still experimental
before compiling javascript classes with babel became popular react had support for a factory component that returns an object with a render method

specifying count as a list of dependencies would fix the bug but would cause the interval to be reset on every change effectively each setinterval would get one chance to execute before being cleared similar to a timeout that may not be desirable to fix this we can use the functional update form of setstate docs hooks reference html functional updates it lets us specify how the state needs to change without referencing the current state
react lazy and suspense is not yet available for server side rendering if you want to do code splitting in a server rendered app we recommend loadable components https github com smooth code loadable component it has a nice guide for bundle splitting with server side render https github Com smooth code loadedable components blob master packages server readme md
as a last resort if you want to something like this in a class you can use a ref docs hooks faq html is there something like instance variables to hold a mutable variable then you can write and read to it for example
for example maybe you have a complex component that contains a lot of local state that is managed in an ad hoc way usestate doesn t make centralizing the update logic any easier so might you prefer to write it as a redux https redux js org reducer

instead of rowmixin we will define a row component we will also replace the convention of defining a getheadertext method with the standard mechanism of top data flow in react passing props
the problem is that purecomponent will do a simple comparison between the old and new values of this props words since this code mutates the words array in the handleclick method of wordadder the old n new value of this prop words will compare as equal even though the actual words in the array have changed the listofwords will thus not update even though it has new words that should be rendered

react uses a i virtual dom li representation for ultra high performance it can also
document getelementbyid example
creates a component given a specification a component implements a render method which returns one single child that child may have an arbitrarily deep child structure one thing that makes components different than a standard prototypal classes is that you don t need to call new on them they are convenience wrappers that construct backing instances via new for you
thrown if the prop isn t provided
duplicated data from props try to use props as the source of truth where possible because props can change over time it s appropriate to store props in state to be able to know its previous values
after shadowrenderer render has been called you can use shallowrenderer getrenderoutput shallowrenderoutput to get the shallowly rendered output
any components below the root will also get unmounted and have their state destroyed for example when diffing
you ll need to change this props to props both times it appears many components in your apps will be able to written as functional components these components tend to be easier to write and react will optimize them more in the future
determining how an immutable object has changed is considerably easier if the object being referenced is different from before then the object has change that s it
at this point board only needs renderstep and render the state initialization and click handler should both live in game
in the previous code example i suggest using the slice operator to copy the squares array prior to making changes and to prevent mutating the existing array let s talk about what this means and why it an important concept to learn

similar to rendertostring except this doesn t create extra dom attributes such as data react id that react uses internally this is useful if you want to use react as a simple static page generator as stripping away the extra attributes can save lots of bytes
the size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging react now uses rollup https rollupjs org to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats resulting in both size and runtime performance wins the flat bundle format also means that react s impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how your ship your app whether it s with webpack browserify the pre built umd bundles or any other system
while you could add a ref to to the child component adding a ref too to a class component this is not an ideal solution as you would only get a component instance rather than a dom node additionally this wouldn t work with functional components

there is nothing bad about using state or lifecycle hooks in components like any powerful features they should be used in moderation but we have no intention to remove them on the contrary we think they are integral parts of what makes react useful we might enable more functional patterns https github com reactjs react future tree master 07 20 20returning 20state in the future but both local state and lifecycle hook will be a part of that model

alternatively you could have achieve this by passing the todo an islastunfinisheditem prop let it check this prop in componentdidupdate then animate itself however this quickly gets messy if you pass around different props to control animations
on ie8 the onscroll event doesn t bubble and ie8 doesn t have an api to define handlers to the capturing phase of an event meaning there is no way for react to listen to these events

getsnapshotbeforeupdate is invoked right before the most recently rendered output is committed to e g the dom it enables your component to capture current values e g scroll position before they are potential changed any value returned by this lifecycle will be passed as a parameter to componentdidupdate
when a component is removed from within a react tree the cleanup is performed automatically but because we are removing the entire tree by hand we must call it this method
reorders can also cause issues with component state when indexes are used as keys component instances are updated and reused based on their key if the key is an index moving an item changes it as a result component state for things like controlled inputs can get mixed up and updated in unexpected ways
react previously shipped with an experimental context api the old api will be supported in all 16 x releases but applications using it should migrate to the new version the legacy api will been removed in a future major react version read the legacy context docs here docs legacy context html
we are introducing a new static lifecycle getderivedstatefromprops
the stream returned from this method will return a byte stream encoded in utf 8 if you need a stream in another encoding take a look at a project like iconv lite https www npmjs com package icon v lite which provides transform streams for transcoding text
a good place is to start is with routes most people on the web are used to
why is setstate is giving me the wrong value
if you see no output it means s that it completed successfully
footerlink to docs defaultitem html
specifying count as a list of dependencies would fix the bug but would cause the interval to be reset on every change effectively each setinterval would get one chance to execute before being cleared similar to a timeout that may not be desirable to fix this we can use the functional update form of setstate docs hooks reference html functional updates it lets us specify how the state needs to change without referencing the current state
react lazy and suspense is not yet available for server side rendering if you want to do code splitting in a server rendered app we recommend loadable components https github com smooth code loadable component it has a nice guide for bundle splitting with server side render https github Com smooth code loadedable components blob master packages server readme md
if you want to preserve google closure compiler advanced mode crushing resilience make sure to never access as a property what was specified as a string this means you must access using this refs myrefstring if your ref was defined as ref myref string
for example files inside src renderers dom client https github com facebook react tree master src renderer dom client may import other files in the same folder as below
before jordan s work even made its way into the facebook codebase adam hupp implemented an xhp like concept for javascript written in haskell this system enabled you to write the following inside a javascript file
it does this by iterating on the keys of the objects being compared and returning false when the value of a key in each object are not strictly equal

this example will function much like the uncontrolled components example above

img src images docs outerclick with keyboard gif alt a toggle button opening a popover list implemented with the click outside pattern and operated with the keyboard showing the popover not being closed on blur and it obscuring other screen elements
placing the history state into the game component lets us remove the squares state from its child board component just like we lifted state up lifting state up from the square component into the board component we are now lifting it up from them board into the top level game component this gives the game components full control over what the board s data and lets it instruct the board to render past turns from the history
react calls the function specified as onchange on the dom input in our case this is the handlechange method in temperatureinput component
we ll set the the first move to be x by default we can set this default by modifying the initial state in our board constructor
there are various ways to work around this issue the easiest one is to write unicode character directly in javascript you need to make sure that the file is saved as utfs 8 and that the proper utf 8 directives are set so the browser will display it correctly
note that native html element names start with a lowercase letter while custom react classes names begin with an uppercase letter
you have no way of determining which data has changed since the previous copy is overridden instead you need to create a new copy of mydata and change only the parts of it that need to be changed then you can compare the old copy of yourdata with the new one in shouldcomponentupdate using triple equals
as a last resort if you want to something like this in a class you can use a ref docs hooks faq html is there something like instance variables to hold a mutable variable then you can write and read to it for example
for example maybe you have a complex component that contains a lot of local state that is managed in an ad hoc way usestate doesn t make centralizing the update logic any easier so might you prefer to write it as a redux https redux js org reducer

recommendation to reset all internal state use the key attribute
you can also double click on a particular bar to view more information about that commit
return an object representing the rendered tree unlike tojson the representation is more detailed than the one provided by tojson and includes the user written components you probably don t need this method unless you re writing your own assertion library on top of the test renderer
any child in the tree inside todosapp can read use the dispatch function to pass actions up to todos app
constructor function components don t need a constructor you can initialize the state in the usestate docs hooks reference html usestate call if computing it is expensive you can pass a function to usestate

objects in a typical rest system are addressable by uri and interacted with using verbs in the http protocol an http get to a particular uri fetches and object and returns a server specified set of fields an http put edits an object an http delete deletes an object and so on

propstypes
on top of this react provides a component lifecycle function shouldcomponentupdate which is triggered before the re rendering process starts virtual dom comparison and possible eventual dom reconciliation giving the developer the ability to short circuit this process the default implementation of this function returns true leaving react to perform the update
in rare situations an element may want to change the props of a element that it doesn t own like changing the classname of an element passed as this props children other times it may want t make multiple copies of any element passed to it clonewithprops makes this possible
in the example above since shouldcomponentupdate returned false for the subtree rooted at c2 react had no need to generate the new virtual dom and therefore it neither needed to reconcile the dom note that react didn t even had to invoke shouldcomponent update on c4 and c5
the api is similar to react createclass with the exception or getinitialstate instead of providing a separate getinitial state method you set up your own state property in the constructor
if you mutate something you destroy the original value therefore there is nothing to diff against imaging something like this
any additional user defined properties will be become properties of the rendered component for example here s how you would you render a ul with css class
duplicated data from props try to use props as the source of truth where possible one valid use to store props in state is to be able to know it s previous values because props can change over time
splice array of arrays for each item in array call splice on the target with the parameters provided by the item
this is a subtle difference but defaultprops are now resolved at reactelement creation time instead of when it s mounted this is means that we can avoid allocating an extra object for the resolve props
we wanted to make it easier for new users to see the parallel with the dom and why react is different to align our terminology we now use the term reactelement instead of descriptor likewise we use the terms reactnode instead of renderable
imagine if react createclass was just a plain javascript class if you call a class as a plain function you would call the component s constructor to create an component instance not a reactelement
stoyan stefanov http www phpied com gave a talk at braziljs http babeljs com br about react and wrote an article with the content of the presentation he goes through the difficulties of writing active apps using the dom api and shows how react handles it
this means that displaying 1000 nodes would require in the order of one billion comparisons this is far too expensive for our use case to put this number in perspective cpus nowadays execute roughly 3 billion instructions per second so even with the most performant implementation we wouldn t be able to compute that diff in less than a second

however if the bundler is misconfigured you can accidentally ship development code into production we can t completely prevent this but we took a few steps to mitigate the common cases when it happens
we could get away with this because the code that touches the dom is consolidated in a few files and doesn t change that often every week we update the facebook com codebase to the latest react commit on master at facebook we use a set of internal webdriver http www seleniumhq org projects webdriver tests for critical product workflows and these catch some regressions react updates are first delivered to employees so severe bugs get reported immediately before they reach two billion of users
react components are small resuable pieces of code that return a react element to be rendered to the page the simplest version of react component is a plain javascript function that returns an react element

objects in a typical rest system are addressable by uri and interacted with using verbs in the http protocol an http get to a particular uri fetches and object and returns a server specified set of fields an http put edits an object an http delete deletes an object and so on
you can create one of these object through react createelement

in rare situations an element may want to change the props of a element that it doesn t own like changing the classname of an element passed as this props children other times it may want t make multiple copies of any element passed to it clonewithprops makes this possible
in the example above since shouldcomponentupdate returned false for the subtree rooted at c2 react had no need to generate the new virtual dom and therefore it neither needed to reconcile the dom note that react didn t even had to invoke shouldcomponent update on c4 and c5
the api is similar to react createclass with the exception or getinitialstate instead of providing a separate getinitial state method you set up your own state property in the constructor

placing the history state into the game component lets us remove the squares state from its child board component just like we lifted state up lifting state up from the square component into the board component we are now lifting it up from them board into the top level game component this gives the game components full control over what the board s data and lets it instruct the board to render past turns from the history

the size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging react now uses rollup https rollupjs org to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats resulting in both size and runtime performance wins the flat bundle format also means that react s impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how your ship your app whether it s with webpack browserify the pre built umd bundles or any other system

specifying count as a list of dependencies would fix the bug but would cause the interval to be reset on every change effectively each setinterval would get one chance to execute before being cleared similar to a timeout that may not be desirable to fix this we can use the functional update form of setstate docs hooks reference html functional updates it lets us specify how the state needs to change without referencing the current state
react lazy and suspense is not yet available for server side rendering if you want to do code splitting in a server rendered app we recommend loadable components https github com smooth code loadable component it has a nice guide for bundle splitting with server side render https github Com smooth code loadedable components blob master packages server readme md
you have multiple conflicting copies of react loaded eg due to a miss configured npm dependency
after shadowrenderer render has been called you can use shallowrenderer getrenderoutput shallowrenderoutput to get the shallowly rendered output
any components below the root will also get unmounted and have their state destroyed for example when diffing
you ll need to change this props to props both times it appears many components in your apps will be able to written as functional components these components tend to be easier to write and react will optimize them more in the future
determining how an immutable object has changed is considerably easier if the object being referenced is different from before then the object has change that s it
at this point board only needs renderstep and render the state initialization and click handler should both live in game
in the previous code example i suggest using the slice operator to copy the squares array prior to making changes and to prevent mutating the existing array let s talk about what this means and why it an important concept to learn
it s exciting to see the number of real world react applications and components skyrocket over the past months this community round up features a few examples of inspiring react applicationsand components

component classes created by createclass return instances of reactcomponent when called most of the time when you re using react you re either creating or consuming these component objects
these six functions can be polyfilled using a combination of es5 shim js and es5 sham js from kriskowal s es5 shader https github com kriskoal es5shim
the following svg elements are supported
alternatively you could have achieve this by passing the todo an islastunfinisheditem prop let it check this prop in componentdidupdate then animate itself however this quickly gets messy if you pass around different props to control animations
on ie8 the onscroll event doesn t bubble and ie8 doesn t have an api to define handlers to the capturing phase of an event meaning there is no way for react to listen to these events
david nolan http swannodette github io announced om a thin wrapper on top of react in clojurescript it stands out by only using immutable data structures this unlocks the ability to write a very efficient shouldcomponentupdate http facebook github io react docs component specs html updating shouldcomponent update and get huge performance improvements on some tasks
linkedstatemixin adds a method to your react component called linkstate linkstate returns a reactlink object which contains the current value of the react state and a callback to change it
reactdom render and reactdom unstable renderintocontainer now return null if called from inside a lifecycle method to work around this you can use portals https github com facebook react issues 10309 issuecomment 318433235 or refs https github Com facebook reactissues 10309 issuescomment 318334635

the size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging react now uses rollup https rollupjs org to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats resulting in both size and runtime performance wins the flat bundle format also means that react s impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how your ship your app whether it s with webpack browserify the pre built umd bundles or any other system
while you could add a ref to to the child component adding a ref too to a class component this is not an ideal solution as you would only get a component instance rather than a dom node additionally this wouldn t work with functional components

next we will extract a userinfo component that renders an avatar next to user s name
using an arrow in render creates a new function each time the component renders which may have performance implications see below
you can read more about it in react fiber architecture https github com acdlite react fiber architectures while it has shipped with react 16 the async features are not enabled by default yet

react suspense let you specify the loading indicator in case some components in the tree below it are not yet ready to render today lazy loading components is the only use case supported by react suspense
by default effects run after every completed render but you can choose to fire it only when certain values have changed conditionally firing an effect
frameworks like jest also let you save snapshots of data with tomatchsnapshot tomatchinlinesnapshot https jestjs io docs en snapshot testing with these we can save the rendered component output and ensure that a change to it has to be explicitly committed as a changes to the snapshot
if you re struggling to imagine what how an internal instance tree is structured in more complex applications react devtools https github com facebook react dev tools can give you a close approximation as it highlights host instances with grey and composite instances with purple
similar to rendertostring except this doesn t create extra dom attributes such as data react id that react uses internally this is useful if you want to use react as a simple static page generator as stripping away the extra attributes can save lots of bytes

in order to use react client side in your application you must make sure the browser requests it one way to do that is to drop react js into app assets javascript and by default your application manifest will pick it up there are downsides to this approach so we made it even easier once you have react rails installed you can just add a line into your config file see configuring and require react directly in your manifest
these is a simple usecase where the luigi tab is disable by default you can also use tab to focus tabs and use arrow left right or up down to switch tabs
this event handler is called every time a tab is about to changed it will be called with the index that will be changed to the lastindex which was selected before and the underlying event which is usually either a keydown or click event when index and lastindex are equal it means the user clicked on the currently active tab
this mode also enforces you to set a handler for onselect defaultindex does not have any effect and will therefore throw an error
you should never need to use this in the browser only if you are running a isomorphic react app that is rendered on the server you should call resetidcounter before every render so that the ids that get generated on the servers match the  ids generated in the browsers

at this point board only needs renderstep and render the state initialization and click handler should both live in game
in the previous code example i suggest using the slice operator to copy the squares array prior to making changes and to prevent mutating the existing array let s talk about what this means and why it an important concept to learn
if you re struggling to imagine what how an internal instance tree is structured in more complex applications react devtools https github com facebook react dev tools can give you a close approximation as it highlights host instances with grey and composite instances with purple
similar to rendertostring except this doesn t create extra dom attributes such as data react id that react uses internally this is useful if you want to use react as a simple static page generator as stripping away the extra attributes can save lots of bytes

when a component is removed from within a react tree the cleanup is performed automatically but because we are removing the entire tree by hand we must call it this method
reorders can also cause issues with component state when indexes are used as keys component instances are updated and reused based on their key if the key is an index moving an item changes it as a result component state for things like controlled inputs can get mixed up and updated in unexpected ways

tip a repository with an extensive amount of content about best practices and redux architecture shared by markersikson at react redux links https github com markerikson react reduc links
early redux documentation advised that you should only have a few connected components near the top of your component tree however time and experience has shown that that generally requires a few components to know too much about the data requirements of all their descendants and forces them to pass down a confusing number of props
a big source of confusion when it comes to a large project is what to name things this is often just as important as the code itself defining a naming convention for your actions at the very beginning of a project and sticking to that convention helps you to scale up as the scope of the project grows
subscribers are intended to respond to the state value itself not the action updates to the states processed synchronously but notifications to subscribers can be batched or debounced meaning that subscribers are not always notified with every action this is a common performance optimization http redux js org docs faq performance html performance update events to avoid repeated re rendering

frameworks like jest also let you save snapshots of data with tomatchsnapshot tomatchinlinesnapshot https jestjs io docs en snapshot testing with these we can save the rendered component output and ensure that a change to it has to be explicitly committed as a changes to the snapshot
objects in a typical rest system are addressable by uri and interacted with using verbs in the http protocol an http get to a particular uri fetches and object and returns a server specified set of fields an http put edits an object an http delete deletes an object and so on
you can create one of these object through react createelement
propstypes
on top of this react provides a component lifecycle function shouldcomponentupdate which is triggered before the re rendering process starts virtual dom comparison and possible eventual dom reconciliation giving the developer the ability to short circuit this process the default implementation of this function returns true leaving react to perform the update
in rare situations an element may want to change the props of a element that it doesn t own like changing the classname of an element passed as this props children other times it may want t make multiple copies of any element passed to it clonewithprops makes this possible
in the example above since shouldcomponentupdate returned false for the subtree rooted at c2 react had no need to generate the new virtual dom and therefore it neither needed to reconcile the dom note that react didn t even had to invoke shouldcomponent update on c4 and c5
the api is similar to react createclass with the exception or getinitialstate instead of providing a separate getinitial state method you set up your own state property in the constructor
if you mutate something you destroy the original value therefore there is nothing to diff against imaging something like this
any additional user defined properties will be become properties of the rendered component for example here s how you would you render a ul with css class
duplicated data from props try to use props as the source of truth where possible one valid use to store props in state is to be able to know it s previous values because props can change over time
splice array of arrays for each item in array call splice on the target with the parameters provided by the item
this is a subtle difference but defaultprops are now resolved at reactelement creation time instead of when it s mounted this is means that we can avoid allocating an extra object for the resolve props
we wanted to make it easier for new users to see the parallel with the dom and why react is different to align our terminology we now use the term reactelement instead of descriptor likewise we use the terms reactnode instead of renderable
imagine if react createclass was just a plain javascript class if you call a class as a plain function you would call the component s constructor to create an component instance not a reactelement
we provide the exhaustive deps https github com facebook react issues 14920 eslint rule as a part of the esplint plugin react hooks https www npmjs com package eslints plugin react hook installation package it help you find components that don t handle updates consistently
this pattern was almost never used in the wild and supporting it causes react to be slightly larger and slower than necessary so we are deprecating this pattern in 16 9 and logging a warning if it s encountered if you rely on it adding factorycomponent prototype react component prototype can serve as a workaround alternatively you can convert it to either a class or a function component
react calls calls this function any time a component within the profiled tree commits an update
interactions can be used to identify the cause of an update along the api for tracing them is still experimental
before compiling javascript classes with babel became popular react had support for a factory component that returns an object with a render method
can t find your language if you d like to maintain your language s translation fork follow the instructions in the translation repo https github com reactjs reactjs org translation starting a new translation
specifying count as a list of dependencies would fix the bug but would cause the interval to be reset on every change effectively each setinterval would get one chance to execute before being cleared similar to a timeout that may not be desirable to fix this we can use the functional update form of setstate docs hooks reference html functional updates it lets us specify how the state needs to change without referencing the current state
react lazy and suspense is not yet available for server side rendering if you want to do code splitting in a server rendered app we recommend loadable components https github com smooth code loadable component it has a nice guide for bundle splitting with server side render https github Com smooth code loadedable components blob master packages server readme md
as a last resort if you want to something like this in a class you can use a ref docs hooks faq html is there something like instance variables to hold a mutable variable then you can write and read to it for example
for example maybe you have a complex component that contains a lot of local state that is managed in an ad hoc way usestate doesn t make centralizing the update logic any easier so might you prefer to write it as a redux https redux js org reducer

the size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging react now uses rollup https rollupjs org to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats resulting in both size and runtime performance wins the flat bundle format also means that react s impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how your ship your app whether it s with webpack browserify the pre built umd bundles or any other system

onclick is a callback to invoke when link is clicked
serialization enables the browser to store all actions that have been dispatched as well as the previous store states with much less memory rewinding and hot reloading the store is central to the redux developer experience and the function of redux devtools this also enables deserialized actions to be stored on the server and re serialized in the browser in the case of server side rendering with redux
one approach is to merge the contents of the action in to the existing state in this case we need to do a deep recursive merge not just a shallow copy the lodash merge function can handle this for us
react redux performs a shallow equality check on on each value within the props object not on the props objects itself
converting an immutable js object to a javascript object using tojs will return a new object every time if you do this in mapsatetoprops you will cause the component to believe that the object has changed every time the state tree changes and so trigger an unnecessary re render
note that native html element names start with a lowercase letter while custom react classes names begin with an uppercase letter
you have no way of determining which data has changed since the previous copy is overridden instead you need to create a new copy of mydata and change only the parts of it that need to be changed then you can compare the old copy of yourdata with the new one in shouldcomponentupdate using triple equals
some common rules of thumb for determining what kind of data should be put into redux
before integrating react router we need to configure our development servers indeed our development server may be unaware of the declared routes in react router configuration for example if you access todos and refresh your development server needs to be instructed to serve index html because it is a single page app here s how to enable this with popular development servers
1 the listener should only call dispatch either in response to user actions or under specific conditions e g dispatching an action when the store has a specific field calling dispatch dispatch without any conditions is technically possible however it leads to infinite loop as every dispatch dispatch call usually triggers the listener again
additionally as we are using es6 and jsx syntax we will need to compile with babel https babeljs io see this example of a this examples of a node server with babels https github com babel example node server and the react preset https babelsjs io docs plugins preset react
recipes structuring reducers prerequisite concepts docs recipes reducers preconcepts
react router redux creates a binding between your redux app and react router and it keeps them in sync without this binding you will not be able to rewind the actions with time travel unless you need this react routers and redux can operates completely apart
returns state map todo index
note that a normalized state structure generally implies that more components are connected and each responsible for looking up their own data as opposed to a few connected components looking up large amounts of data and passing all that data downwards as it turns out having connected parent components simply pass item ids to connected children is a good pattern for optimizing ui performance in a react redux application so keeping state normalized plays a key role in improving performance
so you want to do routing with your redux app you can use it with react router https github com reactjs react router redux will be the source of truth for your data and react router will be a source of fact for your url in most of the cases it is fine to have them separate unless if you need to time travel and rewind actions that triggers the change url

getsnapshotbeforeupdate is invoked right before the most recently rendered output is committed to e g the dom it enables your component to capture current values e g scroll position before they are potential changed any value returned by this lifecycle will be passed as a parameter to componentdidupdate
when a component is removed from within a react tree the cleanup is performed automatically but because we are removing the entire tree by hand we must call it this method
reorders can also cause issues with component state when indexes are used as keys component instances are updated and reused based on their key if the key is an index moving an item changes it as a result component state for things like controlled inputs can get mixed up and updated in unexpected ways
react previously shipped with an experimental context api the old api will be supported in all 16 x releases but applications using it should migrate to the new version the legacy api will been removed in a future major react version read the legacy context docs here docs legacy context html
we are introducing a new static lifecycle getderivedstatefromprops
the stream returned from this method will return a byte stream encoded in utf 8 if you need a stream in another encoding take a look at a project like iconv lite https www npmjs com package icon v lite which provides transform streams for transcoding text
react uses a i virtual dom li representation for ultra high performance it can also
document getelementbyid example
creates a component given a specification a component implements a render method which returns one single child that child may have an arbitrarily deep child structure one thing that makes components different than a standard prototypal classes is that you don t need to call new on them they are convenience wrappers that construct backing instances via new for you
thrown if the prop isn t provided
duplicated data from props try to use props as the source of truth where possible because props can change over time it s appropriate to store props in state to be able to know its previous values
the component chart chart provides this information in the form of a bar chart
img src images docs outerclick with keyboard gif alt a toggle button opening a popover list implemented with the click outside pattern and operated with the keyboard showing the popover not being closed on blur and it obscuring other screen elements
placing the history state into the game component lets us remove the squares state from its child board component just like we lifted state up lifting state up from the square component into the board component we are now lifting it up from them board into the top level game component this gives the game components full control over what the board s data and lets it instruct the board to render past turns from the history
react calls the function specified as onchange on the dom input in our case this is the handlechange method in temperatureinput component
we ll set the the first move to be x by default we can set this default by modifying the initial state in our board constructor
below we loop through the numbers array using the javascript map https developer mozilla org en us docs web javascript reference global objects array map function we return an li element for each item finally we assign the resulting array of elements to listitems
open this this starter code https cdn rawgit com gaearon 0b180827c190fe4fd98b4c7f570ea4a8 raw b9157ce933c79a4559d2aa9ff3372668cce48de7 likebutton js and paste it into the file you created

calls to setstate are asynchronous don t rely on this state to reflect the new value immediately after calling setstate pass an updater function instead of an object if you need compute values based on the current state see below for details
a good place is to start is with routes most people on the web are used to
why is setstate is giving me the wrong value

for now have decided to only convert the source code to es modules but not the tests we use powerful utilities like jest resetmodules and want to retain tighter control over when the modules get initialized in tests in order to consume es modules from our tests we enabled the babel commonjs transform https github com facebook react blob cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095 scripts jest preprocessor js l28 l29 but only for the test environment
however if the bundler is misconfigured you can accidentally ship development code into production we can t completely prevent this but we took a few steps to mitigate the common cases when it happens
we could get away with this because the code that touches the dom is consolidated in a few files and doesn t change that often every week we update the facebook com codebase to the latest react commit on master at facebook we use a set of internal webdriver http www seleniumhq org projects webdriver tests for critical product workflows and these catch some regressions react updates are first delivered to employees so severe bugs get reported immediately before they reach two billion of users
objects in a typical rest system are addressable by uri and interacted with using verbs in the http protocol an http get to a particular uri fetches and object and returns a server specified set of fields an http put edits an object an http delete deletes an object and so on
you can create one of these object through react createelement
propstypes
on top of this react provides a component lifecycle function shouldcomponentupdate which is triggered before the re rendering process starts virtual dom comparison and possible eventual dom reconciliation giving the developer the ability to short circuit this process the default implementation of this function returns true leaving react to perform the update
in rare situations an element may want to change the props of a element that it doesn t own like changing the classname of an element passed as this props children other times it may want t make multiple copies of any element passed to it clonewithprops makes this possible
in the example above since shouldcomponentupdate returned false for the subtree rooted at c2 react had no need to generate the new virtual dom and therefore it neither needed to reconcile the dom note that react didn t even had to invoke shouldcomponent update on c4 and c5
the api is similar to react createclass with the exception or getinitialstate instead of providing a separate getinitial state method you set up your own state property in the constructor
if you mutate something you destroy the original value therefore there is nothing to diff against imaging something like this
if you intend to change to the public api or make any non trivial changes to the implementation we recommend filing an issue https github com facebook react issues new this lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it
you have multiple conflicting copies of react loaded eg due to a miss configured npm dependency
after shadowrenderer render has been called you can use shallowrenderer getrenderoutput shallowrenderoutput to get the shallowly rendered output
any components below the root will also get unmounted and have their state destroyed for example when diffing
you ll need to change this props to props both times it appears many components in your apps will be able to written as functional components these components tend to be easier to write and react will optimize them more in the future
determining how an immutable object has changed is considerably easier if the object being referenced is different from before then the object has change that s it
you can instead make this explicit by pass a ref to your custom component and pass that along to the dom using ref forwarding docs forwarding refs html forwarding ref s to dom components
recommendation to reset all internal state use the key attribute
you can also double click on a particular bar to view more information about that commit
return an object representing the rendered tree unlike tojson the representation is more detailed than the one provided by tojson and includes the user written components you probably don t need this method unless you re writing your own assertion library on top of the test renderer
for the most efficient browserify production build install a few plugins
when it previously rendered the calculator has specified that ontemperaturechange of the celsius temperatureinput is the calculator s handlecelsiuschange method and ontemtemperaturechanged of the fahrenheit temperature input is the calculator s handlefahrenheitchange method so either of these two calculator methods gets called depending on which input we edited
there is nothing bad about using state or lifecycle hooks in components like any powerful features they should be used in moderation but we have no intention to remove them on the contrary we think they are integral parts of what makes react useful we might enable more functional patterns https github com reactjs react future tree master 07 20 20returning 20state in the future but both local state and lifecycle hook will be a part of that model
if the calculator owns the shared state it becomes the source of truth for the current temperature in both inputs it can instruct them both to have values that are consistent with each other since the props of both temperatureinput components are coming from the same parent calculator component the two inputs will always be in sync
in our codebase jsx provides an unambiguous hint to the tools that they are dealing with a react element tree this makes it possible to add build time optimizations such as hoisting constant elements http babeljs io docs plugins transform react constant elements safely lint and codemod internal component usage and include jsx source location https github com facebook react pull 6771 into the warnings
instead of rowmixin we will define a row component we will also replace the convention of defining a getheadertext method with the standard mechanism of top data flow in react passing props
at this point board only needs renderstep and render the state initialization and click handler should both live in game
in the previous code example i suggest using the slice operator to copy the squares array prior to making changes and to prevent mutating the existing array let s talk about what this means and why it an important concept to learn
if you re struggling to imagine what how an internal instance tree is structured in more complex applications react devtools https github com facebook react dev tools can give you a close approximation as it highlights host instances with grey and composite instances with purple
similar to rendertostring except this doesn t create extra dom attributes such as data react id that react uses internally this is useful if you want to use react as a simple static page generator as stripping away the extra attributes can save lots of bytes
if you want to preserve google closure compiler advanced mode crushing resilience make sure to never access as a property what was specified as a string this means you must access using this refs myrefstring if your ref was defined as ref myref string
for example files inside src renderers dom client https github com facebook react tree master src renderer dom client may import other files in the same folder as below

react suspense let you specify the loading indicator in case some components in the tree below it are not yet ready to render today lazy loading components is the only use case supported by react suspense
by default effects run after every completed render but you can choose to fire it only when certain values have changed conditionally firing an effect
frameworks like jest also let you save snapshots of data with tomatchsnapshot tomatchinlinesnapshot https jestjs io docs en snapshot testing with these we can save the rendered component output and ensure that a change to it has to be explicitly committed as a changes to the snapshot
we provide the exhaustive deps https github com facebook react issues 14920 eslint rule as a part of the esplint plugin react hooks https www npmjs com package eslints plugin react hook installation package it help you find components that don t handle updates consistently
this pattern was almost never used in the wild and supporting it causes react to be slightly larger and slower than necessary so we are deprecating this pattern in 16 9 and logging a warning if it s encountered if you rely on it adding factorycomponent prototype react component prototype can serve as a workaround alternatively you can convert it to either a class or a function component
react calls calls this function any time a component within the profiled tree commits an update
interactions can be used to identify the cause of an update along the api for tracing them is still experimental
before compiling javascript classes with babel became popular react had support for a factory component that returns an object with a render method
can t find your language if you d like to maintain your language s translation fork follow the instructions in the translation repo https github com reactjs reactjs org translation starting a new translation
specifying count as a list of dependencies would fix the bug but would cause the interval to be reset on every change effectively each setinterval would get one chance to execute before being cleared similar to a timeout that may not be desirable to fix this we can use the functional update form of setstate docs hooks reference html functional updates it lets us specify how the state needs to change without referencing the current state
react lazy and suspense is not yet available for server side rendering if you want to do code splitting in a server rendered app we recommend loadable components https github com smooth code loadable component it has a nice guide for bundle splitting with server side render https github Com smooth code loadedable components blob master packages server readme md
as a last resort if you want to something like this in a class you can use a ref docs hooks faq html is there something like instance variables to hold a mutable variable then you can write and read to it for example
for example maybe you have a complex component that contains a lot of local state that is managed in an ad hoc way usestate doesn t make centralizing the update logic any easier so might you prefer to write it as a redux https redux js org reducer

splice array of arrays for each item in array call splice on the target with the parameters provided by the item
this is a subtle difference but defaultprops are now resolved at reactelement creation time instead of when it s mounted this is means that we can avoid allocating an extra object for the resolve props
we wanted to make it easier for new users to see the parallel with the dom and why react is different to align our terminology we now use the term reactelement instead of descriptor likewise we use the terms reactnode instead of renderable
imagine if react createclass was just a plain javascript class if you call a class as a plain function you would call the component s constructor to create an component instance not a reactelement

the problem is that purecomponent will do a simple comparison between the old and new values of this props words since this code mutates the words array in the handleclick method of wordadder the old n new value of this prop words will compare as equal even though the actual words in the array have changed the listofwords will thus not update even though it has new words that should be rendered

in its earliest days react benefitted tremendously from feedback ideas and technical contributions of early adopters and collaborators all over the company while it might look like an overnight success in hindsight the story of react is actually a great example of how new ideas often need to go through several rounds of refinement iteration and course correction over a long period of time before reaching their full potential

calls to setstate are asynchronous don t rely on this state to reflect the new value immediately after calling setstate pass an updater function instead of an object if you need compute values based on the current state see below for details
we ll need another public method waitfor note that it returns a promise that can in turn be returned from the store callback
the arguments for waitfor are an array of dispatcher registry indexes and a final callback to invoke after the callbacks at the given indexes have completed thus the store that is invoking waitfor can depend on the state of another store to inform how it should update its own state

relay is also component oriented extending the notion of a react component to include a description of what data is necessary to render it this colocation allows developers to reason locally about their application and eliminates bugs such as under or over fetching data
you can instead make this explicit by pass a ref to your custom component and pass that along to the dom using ref forwarding docs forwarding refs html forwarding ref s to dom components

duplicated data from props try to use props as the source of truth where possible because props can change over time it s appropriate to store props in state to be able to know its previous values

for now have decided to only convert the source code to es modules but not the tests we use powerful utilities like jest resetmodules and want to retain tighter control over when the modules get initialized in tests in order to consume es modules from our tests we enabled the babel commonjs transform https github com facebook react blob cc52e06b490e0dc2482b345aa5d0d65fae931095 scripts jest preprocessor js l28 l29 but only for the test environment
however if the bundler is misconfigured you can accidentally ship development code into production we can t completely prevent this but we took a few steps to mitigate the common cases when it happens

react components are small resuable pieces of code that return a react element to be rendered to the page the simplest version of react component is a plain javascript function that returns an react element

on top of this react provides a component lifecycle function shouldcomponentupdate which is triggered before the re rendering process starts virtual dom comparison and possible eventual dom reconciliation giving the developer the ability to short circuit this process the default implementation of this function returns true leaving react to perform the update
in rare situations an element may want to change the props of a element that it doesn t own like changing the classname of an element passed as this props children other times it may want t make multiple copies of any element passed to it clonewithprops makes this possible
in the example above since shouldcomponentupdate returned false for the subtree rooted at c2 react had no need to generate the new virtual dom and therefore it neither needed to reconcile the dom note that react didn t even had to invoke shouldcomponent update on c4 and c5

the size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging react now uses rollup https rollupjs org to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats resulting in both size and runtime performance wins the flat bundle format also means that react s impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how your ship your app whether it s with webpack browserify the pre built umd bundles or any other system
while you could add a ref to to the child component adding a ref too to a class component this is not an ideal solution as you would only get a component instance rather than a dom node additionally this wouldn t work with functional components

when it previously rendered the calculator has specified that ontemperaturechange of the celsius temperatureinput is the calculator s handlecelsiuschange method and ontemtemperaturechanged of the fahrenheit temperature input is the calculator s handlefahrenheitchange method so either of these two calculator methods gets called depending on which input we edited
there is nothing bad about using state or lifecycle hooks in components like any powerful features they should be used in moderation but we have no intention to remove them on the contrary we think they are integral parts of what makes react useful we might enable more functional patterns https github com reactjs react future tree master 07 20 20returning 20state in the future but both local state and lifecycle hook will be a part of that model
if the calculator owns the shared state it becomes the source of truth for the current temperature in both inputs it can instruct them both to have values that are consistent with each other since the props of both temperatureinput components are coming from the same parent calculator component the two inputs will always be in sync

react calls the function specified as onchange on the dom input in our case this is the handlechange method in temperatureinput component

this pattern was almost never used in the wild and supporting it causes react to be slightly larger and slower than necessary so we are deprecating this pattern in 16 9 and logging a warning if it s encountered if you rely on it adding factorycomponent prototype react component prototype can serve as a workaround alternatively you can convert it to either a class or a function component

specifying count as a list of dependencies would fix the bug but would cause the interval to be reset on every change effectively each setinterval would get one chance to execute before being cleared similar to a timeout that may not be desirable to fix this we can use the functional update form of setstate docs hooks reference html functional updates it lets us specify how the state needs to change without referencing the current state
react lazy and suspense is not yet available for server side rendering if you want to do code splitting in a server rendered app we recommend loadable components https github com smooth code loadable component it has a nice guide for bundle splitting with server side render https github Com smooth code loadedable components blob master packages server readme md
as a last resort if you want to something like this in a class you can use a ref docs hooks faq html is there something like instance variables to hold a mutable variable then you can write and read to it for example
for example maybe you have a complex component that contains a lot of local state that is managed in an ad hoc way usestate doesn t make centralizing the update logic any easier so might you prefer to write it as a redux https redux js org reducer

this is a subtle difference but defaultprops are now resolved at reactelement creation time instead of when it s mounted this is means that we can avoid allocating an extra object for the resolve props

note this should only be done for new releases you should create a tag corresponding to the release tag in the main repository
another important part is the registration of the store s callback with the dispatcher we pass in our payload handling callback to the dispatcher and preserve the index that this store has in the dispatcher s registry the callback function currently only handles one actiontype but later we can add as many as we need
we ll need another public method waitfor note that it returns a promise that can in turn be returned from the store callback
we ll need another public method waitfor note that it returns a promise that can in turn be returned from the store callback
the arguments for waitfor are an array of dispatcher registry indexes and a final callback to invoke after the callbacks at the given indexes have completed thus the store that is invoking waitfor can depend on the state of another store to inform how it should update its own state
it s exciting to see the number of real world react applications and components skyrocket over the past months this community round up features a few examples of inspiring react applicationsand components
is desguared into native javascript
component classes created by createclass return instances of reactcomponent when called most of the time when you re using react you re either creating or consuming these component objects
these six functions can be polyfilled using a combination of es5 shim js and es5 sham js from kriskowal s es5 shader https github com kriskoal es5shim
the following svg elements are supported
alternatively you could have achieve this by passing the todo an islastunfinisheditem prop let it check this prop in componentdidupdate then animate itself however this quickly gets messy if you pass around different props to control animations
on ie8 the onscroll event doesn t bubble and ie8 doesn t have an api to define handlers to the capturing phase of an event meaning there is no way for react to listen to these events
after shadowrenderer render has been called you can use shallowrenderer getrenderoutput shallowrenderoutput to get the shallowly rendered output
any components below the root will also get unmounted and have their state destroyed for example when diffing
you ll need to change this props to props both times it appears many components in your apps will be able to written as functional components these components tend to be easier to write and react will optimize them more in the future
determining how an immutable object has changed is considerably easier if the object being referenced is different from before then the object has change that s it
at this point board only needs renderstep and render the state initialization and click handler should both live in game
in the previous code example i suggest using the slice operator to copy the squares array prior to making changes and to prevent mutating the existing array let s talk about what this means and why it an important concept to learn
if you re struggling to imagine what how an internal instance tree is structured in more complex applications react devtools https github com facebook react dev tools can give you a close approximation as it highlights host instances with grey and composite instances with purple
similar to rendertostring except this doesn t create extra dom attributes such as data react id that react uses internally this is useful if you want to use react as a simple static page generator as stripping away the extra attributes can save lots of bytes
the size difference is partly attributable to a change in packaging react now uses rollup https rollupjs org to create flat bundles for each of its different target formats resulting in both size and runtime performance wins the flat bundle format also means that react s impact on bundle size is roughly consistent regardless of how your ship your app whether it s with webpack browserify the pre built umd bundles or any other system
while you could add a ref to to the child component adding a ref too to a class component this is not an ideal solution as you would only get a component instance rather than a dom node additionally this wouldn t work with functional components
for the most efficient browserify production build install a few plugins
when it previously rendered the calculator has specified that ontemperaturechange of the celsius temperatureinput is the calculator s handlecelsiuschange method and ontemtemperaturechanged of the fahrenheit temperature input is the calculator s handlefahrenheitchange method so either of these two calculator methods gets called depending on which input we edited
there is nothing bad about using state or lifecycle hooks in components like any powerful features they should be used in moderation but we have no intention to remove them on the contrary we think they are integral parts of what makes react useful we might enable more functional patterns https github com reactjs react future tree master 07 20 20returning 20state in the future but both local state and lifecycle hook will be a part of that model
if the calculator owns the shared state it becomes the source of truth for the current temperature in both inputs it can instruct them both to have values that are consistent with each other since the props of both temperatureinput components are coming from the same parent calculator component the two inputs will always be in sync
in our codebase jsx provides an unambiguous hint to the tools that they are dealing with a react element tree this makes it possible to add build time optimizations such as hoisting constant elements http babeljs io docs plugins transform react constant elements safely lint and codemod internal component usage and include jsx source location https github com facebook react pull 6771 into the warnings
instead of rowmixin we will define a row component we will also replace the convention of defining a getheadertext method with the standard mechanism of top data flow in react passing props
the problem is that purecomponent will do a simple comparison between the old and new values of this props words since this code mutates the words array in the handleclick method of wordadder the old n new value of this prop words will compare as equal even though the actual words in the array have changed the listofwords will thus not update even though it has new words that should be rendered
the compose utility function is provided by many third party libraries including lodash as lodash flowright https lodash com docs flowright redux http redux js org docs api compose html and ramda http ramdajs com docs compose
in its earliest days react benefitted tremendously from feedback ideas and technical contributions of early adopters and collaborators all over the company while it might look like an overnight success in hindsight the story of react is actually a great example of how new ideas often need to go through several rounds of refinement iteration and course correction over a long period of time before reaching their full potential

a spring simply animates values from one state to another updates are accumulative strings remember all the values you ever pass you can use arbitrary names there are a couple of reserved keywords like from for base values you can learn about the api here api the received props are not static values these props are self updating you cannot use them in regular divs and such
values that apply to new elements or fitem values
reorders can also cause issues with component state when indexes are used as keys component instances are updated and reused based on their key if the key is an index moving an item changes it as a result component state for things like controlled inputs can get mixed up and updated in unexpected ways
react previously shipped with an experimental context api the old api will be supported in all 16 x releases but applications using it should migrate to the new version the legacy api will been removed in a future major react version read the legacy context docs here docs legacy context html
we are introducing a new static lifecycle getderivedstatefromprops

to completely override the filter that is shown you can set the filter column option using this option you can specify the jsx that is show the option is passed an onchange method which must be called with the the value that you want to pass to the filtermethod option whenever the filter has changed
alternatively you can set filterall to true and filtermethod will be passed the entire array of rows to be filtered and you will then be responsible for returning the new filtered array this is extremely handy when you need to utilize a utility like fuzzy matching that requires the entire arrays of items

react spring builds upon animated s foundation casting its imperative side out making it leaner and more flexible it inherits react motions declarative api and goes to great lengths to simplify it it has lots of useful primitives can interpolate mostly everything and last but not least can animate by committing directly to the dom instead of re rendering a component frame by frame
react spring is a cooked down fork of christopher chedeau s animated https github com animatedjs animated which is used in react native by default it is trying to bridge it with cheng lou s react motion https githubcom chenglou react motion although both are similar in that they are spring physics based they have their pros and cons and could definitively benefit from one another
react spring will re render the receiving component on every frame it is usually fine and give you more freedom to animate whatever you like if you need more performance supply the native flag now your component will only render once and all updates will efficiently be applied to it outside of reacts render loop

since we are not using rei interface files we are now able to abstract these types away for functions that get included into our implementation modules see rei topic below
relude has a fairly complete test suite and is being used in production at at least two companies however it s still a relatively young project is subject to breaking changes and likely has some bugs some of the function implementations are not optimized as we have been more focused on the interfaces rather than the implementations initially we hope to improve implementations and performance over time
unlike belt https bucklescript github io beltjscript api belt html relude prefers significant data last i e pipe last or thread last semantics this means you ll tend to use the operator with relude functions instead of this was a concious decision in favor of more natural partial application and composition of functions without the need for compiler magic and is also more in line with the conventions of other fp languages

this change was neccesary because in redux v4 you are no longer supposed to dispatch actions while middleware is still be setup which an epic could have done with the previous api
this approach essentially returns an empty observable from the epic which does not cause any downstream actions
the actions you emit will be immediately dispatched through the normal store dispatch so under the hood redux observable effectively does epic actions store subscribe store dispatch
it is an advanced api you might need this if your app implements code splitting and you want to load some of the epics dynamically or you implement use hot reloading
of course you ll usually create action factories instead
