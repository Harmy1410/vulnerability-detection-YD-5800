by default the homepage of an an admin app is the list of the first child resource but you can also specify a custom component instead to fit in the general design use material ui s card component and react admin s title component to set the title in the appbar
in many cases you will need more than simple object manipulation you ll need to augment your objects based on relationships for instance the export for comments should include the title of the related post but the export only exposes a post id by default for that purpose the exporter receives a fetchrelatedrecords function as second parameter it fetches related records using your dataprocesser and redux and returns a promise
you can benefit from optimistic rendering in your own custom actions too you just need to decorate the action with the startundoable action creator
if you want to deeply customize the app header the menu or the notifications the best way is to provide a custom layout component through the applauout prop

note that the crudupdatemany action creator is not present in the mapdispatchtoprops argument of connect in that case only startundoable needs to be dispatched in this case using the result of the Crudup datemany call as parameter

the first command imports the i18n module that provides gettext features the second line does the actual invocation the first argument to the is the gettext package name this causes two things to happen the first is that meson will generate binary mo files and put them to their proper locations when doing an install the second is that it creates a build rule to regenerate the main pot file if you are using the ninja backend this is how you would invoke the rebuild
the the output of these commands is written to the log directory meson logs in your build directory

if a library target is used meson automatically output the c header and the vapi they can be renamed by setting the vala header and vala vapi arguments respectively in this case the second and third elements of the install dir array indicate the destination with true to indicate default directories i e include and share valid vapi
just having a header does say anything about its contents sometimes you need to explicitly check if some function exists this is how we would check whether the function somefunc exists in header someheader h
what sets meson apart from most build systems is that it enforces a separate build directory all files created by the build system are put in the build directory it is actually impossible to do an in source build for people used to building inside their source tree this may seem like a needles complication however there are several benefits to doing only out of source builds these will be explained in the next chapter

then we decorate the class and its properties with decorators
as i mentioned typegraphql makes developing a graphql api an enjoyable process i e by defining the schema using only classes and a bit of decorator magic
you can also attach the resolver to objecttype fields the same way as with authorized decorator authorization md
the only difference is that we have to let typegraphql know that this objecttype is implementing the interfacetype by passing the param implements iperson to the decorator if we implemented more interfaces we would pass the array of interfaces like implements ipERSON ianimal imachine
as a result we will automatically scope caches to the branch that they are running against the caches will also be hierarchical so a feature branch will be able to get a hit on the master but when populating the cache in the savecache step the contents of that cache won t be used on them master build

aml pipelines can be triggered when tags are added to a commit this is valuable for teams whose workflows include tags for instance you can kick off a process when a commit is tagged as the last known good
triggers are events on which you can start your pipeline run automatically you can enable triggers on your pipeline by subscribing to both internal and external events an event can be completion of a process availability of a resource status update from a service or a timed event
and that s why typegraphql has built in support for validation of arguments and inputs using class validator https github com typestack class validators features you can use awesomeness of decorators to declare the requirement for incoming data e g number is in range 0 255 or password is longer than 8 chars in an easy way
the main idea of typegraphql is to automatically create graphql schema definition from typescript s classes to avoid the need of schema definition files and interfaces describing the schema we use a bit of reflection magic and decorators
we can use the destruction syntax to have access to single arguments as variables instead of the reference to the whole args object
return ctx
graphql s mutations we can create analogously by declaring the class method using mutation decorator providing return type if needed creating arguments etc but for mutation we usually use input types hence why typegraphql allows you to create inputs in the same way as the object types types and fields md but using inputtype decorator

although i am an microsoft employee this is not a microsoft endorsed project it s simply a pet project of mine i love rust who doesn t smirk and microsoft azure technologies so i thought to close the gap between them it s also a good project for learning rust this library relies heavily on hyper https github com hyperium hyper we use the laters hyper code so this library is fully async with futures and tokio

mobx an uncaught exception occurred while calculating the your computed value autorun or transformer or inside the render method of an observer based react component
all components render smartly but are defined in a dumb manner mobx will simple make sure the components are always re rendered whenever needed
since data doesn t need to be normalized and mobx automatically tracks the relations between state and derivations you get referential integrity for free rendering something that is accessed through three levels of indirection no problem mobx will track them and re render whenever one of the references changes as a result staleness bugs are a thing of the past as a programmer you might forget that changing some data might influence an seemingly unrelated component in a corner case mobx won t forget
after completing the transaction s this atoms will notify their observers
mobx is inspired by reactive programming principles as found in spreadsheets it is inspired from mvvm frameworks like in meteorjs tracker knockout and vue js but mobx brings transparent functional reactive programming to the next level and provides a stand alone implementation it implements tfrp in a glitch free synchronous predicatable and efficient manner

overlayfs takes two directories on a single linux host layers one on top of the other and provides a single unified view these directories are often referred to as layers and the technology used to layer them is is known as a union mount the overlayfs terminology is lowerdir for the bottom layer and upperdir forthe top layer the unified view is exposed through its own directory called merged
containers there are several commands that support this and you ll use one in a exercise later

mst solves that by providing the ability to declare model views a model views is declared as a function over the properties first argument of the model declaration model views can accept parameters and only read data from your store if you try to change your store from a model view mst will throw and prevent you from doing so
the second option avoids this reference problem by applying the snapshot to an existing model instance properties will be updated but the store reference will remain the same this will trigger an operation called reconciliation we will speak later about this phase
in part 2 of this tutorial we will discover how to use mst lifecycle hooks and local state to fetch user data from an xhr endpoint and see how environments will help dealing with dependency injection of the parameters needed to fetch our endpoint we will implement auto save using mobx helpers and learn more about patches and actions event streams

some input strings may specify an offset as part of the string itself in these case luxon interprets the time as being specified with that offset but converts the resulting datetime into the system s local zone
you can also load the files from a cdn https www jsdelivr com package npm luxon
luxon has torelative and torelativecalendar for internationalization they use int relativetimeformat which isn t currently supported by most browsers in those cases they fall back to english

class polyenumberformatter
return whether this zone is equal to another zone
if you specify a zone and your environment doesn t support that zone you ll get an invalid validity html datetime that could be because the environment don t support zones at all because for whatever reason doesn t supports that particular zone or because the zone is just bogus like this

luxon is fully usable and i plan to support it indefinitely it s also largely complete it will certainly add relative time formatting and an english only fallback when that becomes possible luxon will also eventually strip out its fallbacks for missing platform features but overall i expect the core functionality to stay basically as it is adding mostly minor tweaks and bugfixes
these ideas has some big advantages
gulp tests run the test suite
1 arguments to luxon s methods are not automatically coerced into moment instances e g m diff 2017 04 01 would be dt diff datetime fromiso 2017 04 0
because the interval stores its endpoints and computes length on the fly it retakes the diff each time you query it of course precisely because an interval isn t an abstract bundle of time it can t be used in places where diffs can for example you can add them to datetime via plus because luxon wouldn t know what units to do the math in see calendar vs time math above but you can convert the interval into a duration by picking the units
some things are ambiguous there are several eastern standard times in different countries and luxon has no way to know which one you mean without additional information such as that the zone is america new york that would make est superfluous anyway similarly the single letter month and weekday formats eeeee that are useful in displaying calendars graphically can t be parsed because ambiguity
1 don t make servers think about local times configure them to use utc and write your server s code to work in utc times can often be thought of a count of epoch milliseconds what you would call that time e g 9 30 in what zone doesn t again often matter

the symbol bson oid t structure represents an object in mongodb it is a 96 bit identifier that includes various information about the system generating the oid
dates can no longer be formatted as raw integers bson as json writes a
new convienince macros
this is useful if you want to check to see if you ve passed a given memory boundary that cannot be sent in a packet see symbol bson writer rollback to abort the current document being written
the following guide will step you through the process of downloading building and installing the current release of the libbson
the symbol bson t structure attempts to use an inline allocation within the structure to speed up performance of small documents when this internal buffer has been exhausted a heap allocated buffer will be dynamically allocated therefore it is essential to call symbol bon destroy on allocated documents
p the bson specification dictates that the encoding format is in little endian many implementations simply ignore endianess altogether and expect that they are to be run on little endan libbson supports both big and littleendian systems this means we use code memcpy code when appropriate instead of dereferencing and properly convert to and from the host endian format we expect the compiler intrinsics to optimize it to a dereference when possible p
p the code error domain code field contains the logical domain within a library that created the error this might be the json subsystem or code xref bson reader t bson writer t code for example p
p this function behaves like code xref bson free bsonfree code except that it zeroes the memory first this can be useful if you are storing passwords or other similarly important data note that if it really is important you probably want an code block code d page as well to prevent it swapping to disk p
returns a newly allocated bson t that should be freed with bson destroy

this visualization is related to the metrics associated with a structured streaming query the graphs shows the number of input rows per second and the numberof rows processed per second the streaming metrics are also represented per application these metrics are sent when the onqueryprogress event is generated as the structured streaming quer is processed and the visualization represents streaming latency as the amount of time in milliseconds taken to execute a query batch
this visualization shows execution latency for a job which is a coarse view on the overall performance of a job displays the job execution duration from start to completion note that the job start time is not the same as the job submission time latency is represented as percentiles 10 30 50 90 of job execution indexed by cluster id and application id

you can also use the seaborn function func diverging palette to create a custom colormap for diverging data naturally there is also a companion interactive widget func choose divergent palette this function makes diverging palettes using the husl color system you pass it two hues in degrees and optionally the lightness and saturation values for the extremes using husl means that the extreme values and the resulting ramps to the midpoint will be well balanced
also available as a matplotlib based palette but this function gives the
call palplot puppyplot

some of this looks familiar sort of this is simply another way of building a javascript object kennel that has a single property a method called render that returns an html representation of some hard coded data you ve done all of that before
when an animal s information is edited the http request will be a put define a method in your animalmanager for the fetch call this method will take two arguments the id of the animal that will be updating as well as the an object that contains the new information for the animal what we want to save to the database
the last thing to refactor is the select element that holds all of the option elements for your moods right now you likely have those hard coded into your html form you now need to query all of those moods from your api with a new fetch method and then dynamically build a new option for each of the moods

specter s api is contained in three files
bug fix eliminate reflection when using primitive parameters in an inline cached path
of what was transformed in the data structure
added late bound parameterization feature allows selectors that require params to be precompiled without the parameters and the parameters are supplied later in bulk this effectively enables specter to be used in any situation with very high performance
looking at the implementations of the built in operations should provide you with the guidance you need to make your own selectors
another function called update is used to perform a transformation on a data structure in addition to a selector it takes in an update function which specified what to do with each element navigated to for example here s how to increment all the even values for a keys in a sequence of maps
the update function receives as argumnets all the collected values followed by the navigated to value so in this case receives the value of the b key follow by the values of the a key and the update is performed to a s value

4 use the results from the previous step to identity the microservices in your application
for a post method the uri represents a parent resource of the new entity such as a collection for example to create a new delivery the urid might be api deliveries the server creates the entity and assigns it a new uri such as api deliverers 39660 this uri is returned in the location header of the response each time the client sends a request the server will create an new entity with a new url
scalability a microservices architecture allows each microservice to be scaled independently of the others that lets you scale out subsystems that require more resources without scaling out the entire application if you deploy services inside containers you can also pack a higher density of microservices onto a single host which allows for more efficient utilization of resources
