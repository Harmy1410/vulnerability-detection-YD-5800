the representation of targets is a set target where each target contains a real the sum of these real s is the probability density function as discussed below this is what will ultimately be passed on to the sampler the other part of target is a placeholders map variable array double that lets us feed in data that would not fit in the compute graph
the representation of targets is a set target where each target contains a real the sum of these real s is the probability density function as discussed below this is what will ultimately be passed on to the sampler the other part of target is a placeholder map variable array double that lets us include variables that are not yet known at compile time
by the way before when we looked at poisson9 densityvalue the model had no parameters and so we got a constant value back now since the model s density is a function of the parameter value we get something more opaque back this is why inspecting density is not normally useful
the key is to remember that a randomvariable has two parts a value and a density mathematically you should think of these as two different functions of the same latent parameter space q that is you should thought of value as being some deterministic function f f q and density as being the unnormalized probability function p q q

if we did started with the store code the amount of changes we d have to do would be very large compared to this this is a smaller step towards our final goal and was driven by tests
test our code if you can test a function easily it s usually because of dependencies hard wired into a function or global state if you have a global database connection pool for instance that is used by some kind of service layer it is likely going to be difficult to test and they will be slow to run di will motivate you to inject in a database dependency via an interface which you can then mock out with something you can control in your tests
it s has one function which expects two arguments the first being where we write our response and the second being the http request that was sent to us

the goal of reinforcement learning rl is to design agents that learn by interacting with an environment in the standard rl setting the agent receives an observation at every time step and chooses an action the action is applied to the environment and the environment returns a reward and and a new observation the agent trains a policy to choose actions to maximize the sum of rewards also known as return n

the store gateway occupies small amounts of disk space for caching basic information about data in the object storage this will rarely exceed more than a few gigabytes and is used to improve restart times it is not useful but not required to preserve it across restarts
it is possible to expose thanos query ui and optionally api on a sub path
thanos supports any object stores that can be implemented against thanos objstore bucket interface pkg objstore objstore go
in it s essence the store api allows to look up data by a set of label matchers as known from promql and a time range it returns compressed chunks of samples as they are found in the block data it is purely a data retrieval api and does not provide complex query execution
note the rule component is experimental since it has conceptual tradeoffs that might not be suitable for most use cases it is recommended to keep deploying rules to the relevant prometheus servers
it continiously synchronizes which blocks exist in the bucket and translates requests for metric data into object storage requests it implements various strategies to minimize the number of requests to the object storage such as filtering relevant blocks by their meta data e g time range and labels and caching frequent index lookups
with the above configuration a single node will advertise itself in the cluster and query for other members of the cluster from itself when you add more sidecars components you will probably want to send cluster peers to a well known peer that will allow you to discover other peers within the cluster

keras js can be run in a webworker separate from the main thread because keras js performs a lot of synchronous computations this can prevent the ui from being affected however one of the biggest limitations of webworkers is the lack of canvas and thus webgl access so the benefits gained by running kerjas js in a separate thread are offset by the necessity of running it in cpu mode only in other words one can run keras s in gpu mode only on the main threads

a computed property is used to declaratively describe a value that depends on other values when you data bind to a computed property inside the template vue knows when to update the dom when any of the values depended upon by the computed property has changed this can be very powerful and makes your code more declarative data driven and thus easier to maintain

vue js precise dependency tracking makes it the one of the most efficient view layer for small hot updates but there s always room for improvement in 0 12 internal instance creation and compilation refactors have improved first render performance for large lists by up to 40 with proper track by usage re rendering with large brand new dataset http vuejs github io js repaint perfs vue is also comparable to or even faster other virtual dom based frameworks
it is common practice to bundle all the javascript into one file when building large single page applications but when the file becomes too large we may want to defer loading parts of our application for a faster initial load however this does pose some constraints on how the application architecture should be designed it could be very tricky to figure out how to properly split up your javascript bundles
in 0 12 the filter argument syntax now follows a simple rules if an argument is enclosed in quotes it will be passed in as a plain string otherwise it will been evaluated against the current vm as a dynamic value

p class tip the src attribute on an image element makes an http requests when a value is set so when the template is first parsed it will result in a 404 in this case v attr is preferred p
most of the options that can be passed into the vue constructor can be used in vue extend however there are two special cases data and el since each vue instance should have its own data and e we obviously don t want the value we passed into vue extends to be shared across all instances created from that constructor so when you want to define how a component should initalize its default data or element you should pass in a function instead
one caveat here is that once the observation has been initiated vue js will not be able detect newly added or deleted properties to get around that observed objects are augmented with add and delete methods
this is a very early preview for the plugin api and this may change in future versions you might want to wait for a few official plugins as reference before writing your own
when the component element is compiled its contents will be replaced with the component s template but the original content will be preserved and inserted into the yield position if no yield outlet is found in the template the originalcontent will be wiped away
some directives don t even expect an attribute value they simply do something to the element once and only once for example the v pre directive
