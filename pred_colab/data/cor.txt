the second goal implies a major design choice the actual logging is completely asynchronous it means that writing messages to the appenders obviously occurs in a background thread but also that all formatting operations are delayed to be performed just before the appending no formatting occurs in the calling thread the log data is merely marshalled to the background logging thread in the more efficient way possible
zerolog is a zero allocation net logging library it uses the excellent formatting library stringformatter https github com mikepopoloski stringformatter

searching the entire directory structure for files to copy based on file extensions is not optimal with large directory structures if we know what non template static content we want to appear in our output we can opt in to specify files or directories for eleventy to copy this will probably speed up your build times these entries are relative to the root of your project and not your eleventy input directory

the default behavior can be overridden by individual providers
you can also attach the resolver to objecttype fields the same way as with authorized decorator authorization md
the only difference is that we have to let typegraphql know that this objecttype is implementing the interfacetype we do it by passing the param implements iperson to the decorator if we implemented more interfaces we would pass the array of interfaces like implements iperson ianimal imachine
and that s why typegraphql has built in support for validation of arguments and inputs using class validator https github com typestack class validator features you can use awesomeness of decorators to declare the requirement for incoming data e g number is in range 0 255 or password is longer than 8 chars in an easy way
the main idea of typegraphql is to automatically create graphql schema definition from typescript s classes to avoid the need of schema definition files and interfaces describing the schema we use a bit of reflection magic and decorators
we can use the destructuring syntax to have access to single arguments as variables instead of the reference to the whole args object

param function movefxn the function to move the context

graphql s mutations we can create analogously by declaring the class method using mutation decorator providing return type if needed creating arguments etc but for mutation we usually use input types hence typegraphql allows you to create inputs in the same way as the object types types and fields md but using inputtype decorator
first what we have to do is to decorate the class with e g objecttype decorator it marks the class as the type known from graphql sdl or graphqlobjecttype from graphql js
the argument but it will be undocumented this is useful if you want to include some secret commands

data ownership and lock in this is an important item make sure you understand who owns the data and whether the company providing a service is using your data in a way you are comfortable with are they using it to train models that they would then offer to your competitors what happens if they decide to stop offering their service what happens with your models how do you get your data sets and trained models off the service

the signature is passed to the application by appending the sig parameter to the query string e g x 1 y 2 z 3 sig c9516346abf62876b6345817dba2f9a0c797ef26 note the application does not include the leading question mark when verifying the supplied signature to verify your signature implementation see the pilbox signature command described in the tools section tools
association tracking for papertrail has been extracted to a separate gem
papertrail version class is not loaded via a rails engine even when the gem is used within rails this feature has

activerecord to allow the regular touch method to generate a version
wish to test against
though be aware we do not have the ability to create the db s except sqlite for
it can also accept a hash as an argument where the key is the attribute to track a string or symbol
paper trail has facilities to test against postgres mysql and sqlite to switch between db engines you will need to export the db variable for the engine you wish to test aganist
if you are about to change some widgets and you don t want a paper trail of your changes you can turn papertrail off like this
in rfc 7159 section 8 1 it states that json text is required to be encoded in utf 8 utf 16 or utf 32 and the default encoding is utf 8 nsjsonserialization provides support for all the encodings listed in the specification and recommends utf 8 for efficiency using an unsupported encoding will result in serialization error see the nsjsonserialization documentation for more details
param receiptid the identifier to use for the download receipt that will be created for this request this must be a unique identifier that does not represent any other request
the image cache used to improve image loading performance on scroll views by default this is an nscache subclass conforming to the afimagecache protocol which listens for notification warnings and evicts objects accordingly
param task the task if nil automatic updating from any previously specified operation will be disabled
afhttprequestoperationmanager encapsulates the common patterns of communicating with a web application over http including request creation response serialization network reachability monitoring and security as well as request operation management
param success a block object to be executed when the request finishes successfully this block has no return value and takes a single argument the image created from the response data of the request
param block a block object to be called when an undetermined number of bytes have been downloaded from the server this block has no return value and takes three arguments the number of bytes read since the last time the download progress block was called the total bytes read and the total bytes expected to be read during the request as initially determined by the expected content size of the nshttpurlresponse object this block may be called multiple times
warning never start solving problems until you have a thorough understanding of current stakeholder requirements otherwise you risk wasting effort in areas which no influential stakeholder cares about
that carry huge financial technical or organizational risks or penalties
whenever you interview stakeholders a thorough preparation will lead to better results interviewers will be less likely to forget important topics

defaults for the application have been optimized for quality rather than performance if you wish to get higher performance out of the application it is recommended you use a less computationally expensive filtering algorithm and a lower jpeg quality for example add the following to the configuration
in order to secure requests so that unknown third parties cannot easily use the resize service the application can require that requests provide a signature to enable this feature set the client key option the signature is a hexadecimal digest of the concatenation of the query string and the client key using the md5 algorithm the below python code provides an example implementation
to verify that your client application is generating correct signatures use the signature command note as in the example below when verifying signatures the web application will not include the leading question mark from the query string when determining the signature

note that outer gaps are an addition to inner gaps so gaps outer all set 0 will eliminate outer gaps but if inner gaps are set there will still be gaps on the edge of the screen
here is an excerpt from my i3 config that shows how this can be utilized press mod shift g to enter a special mode to modify the gap size from there you can press either or 0 to increase decrease the gap size or turn gaps off for the current workspace if you hold shift while doing this it will modify the setting globally for all workspaces
as a general note the gaps branch currently has i3 4 8 merged into it while gaps next is the equivalent of i3 next with my patches
